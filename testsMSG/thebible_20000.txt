And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of thewaters.1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the lightfrom the darkness.1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.And the evening and the morning were the first day.1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,and let it divide the waters from the waters.1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:and it was so.1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and themorning were the second day.1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered togetherunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together ofthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yieldingseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed isin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed afterhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, afterhis kind: and God saw that it was good.1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavento divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights inthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it wasso.1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give lightupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, andto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the movingcreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in theopen firmament of heaven.1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature thatmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fillthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature afterhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after hiskind: and it was so.1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattleafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth afterhis kind: and God saw that it was good.1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowlof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and overevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God createdhe him; male and female created he them.1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, andmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominionover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over everyliving thing that moveth upon the earth.1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the whichis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there islife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it wasvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host ofthem.2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; andhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because thatin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth whenthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and theheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had notcaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till theground.2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the wholeface of the ground.2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a livingsoul.2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there heput the man whom he had formed.2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that ispleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in themidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thenceit was parted, and became into four heads.2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth thewhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of thatland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it thatcompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it whichgoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden ofEden to dress it and to keep it.2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of thegarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledgeof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thoueatest thereof thou shalt surely die.2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should bealone; I will make him an help meet for him.2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of thefield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to seewhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every livingcreature, that was the name thereof.2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found anhelp meet for him.2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and heslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh insteadthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, madehe a woman, and brought her unto the man.2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shallcleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were notashamed.3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field whichthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman saidunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lestye die.3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shallbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and thatit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make onewise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also untoher husband with her; and he did eat.3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that theywere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselvesaprons.3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden inthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from thepresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where artthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I wasafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, shegave me of the tree, and I did eat.3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hastdone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast donethis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of thefield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all thedays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and thewoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,and thou shalt bruise his heel.3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow andthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thydesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voiceof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thornsalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat theherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: fordust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the motherof all living.3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats ofskins, and clothed them.3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, toknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take alsoof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore theLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the groundfrom whence he was taken.3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the gardenof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keepthe way of the tree of life.4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, andsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper ofsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of thefruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and ofthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to hisoffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thycountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not beaccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And untothee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, whenthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,and slew him.4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And hesaid, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, Whathast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me fromthe ground.4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened hermouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thoutillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee herstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I canbear.4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of theearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive anda vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every onethat findeth me shall slay me.4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a markupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in theland of Nod, on the east of Eden.4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and hebuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of hisson, Enoch.4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: andMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,and the name of the other Zillah.4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,and of such as have cattle.4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all suchas handle the harp and organ.4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of everyartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man tomy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy andsevenfold.4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called hisname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed insteadof Abel, whom Cain slew.4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called hisname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that Godcreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and femalecreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in theday when they were created.5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in hisown likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 Andthe days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam livedwere nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 AndSeth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, andbegat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were ninehundred and twelve years: and he died.5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos livedafter he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sonsand daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred andfive years: and he died.5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 AndCainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan werenine hundred and ten years: and he died.5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirtyyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days ofMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begatEnoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were ninehundred sixty and two years: and he died.5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundredyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enochwere three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked withGod: and he was not; for God took him.5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begatLamech.5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eightyand two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days ofMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat ason: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfortus concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the groundwhich the LORD hath cursed.5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and fiveyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamechwere seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,and Japheth.6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of theearth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God sawthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives ofall which they chose.6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, forthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twentyyears.6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they barechildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men ofrenown.6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, andthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evilcontinually.6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and itgrieved him at his heart.6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from theface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, andthe fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfectin his generations, and Noah walked with God.6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filledwith violence.6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; forall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, Iwill destroy them with the earth.6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in theark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The lengthof the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fiftycubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thoufinish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the sidethereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon theearth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from underheaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt comeinto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wiveswith thee.6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shaltthou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall bemale and female.6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, ofevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sortshall come unto thee, to keep them alive.6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shaltgather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so didhe.7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into theark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the maleand his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male andhis female.7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; tokeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earthforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I havemade will I destroy from off the face of the earth.7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters wasupon the earth.7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wiveswith him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in twoand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God hadcommanded Noah.7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of theflood were upon the earth.7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountainsof the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sonswith them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing thatcreepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,every bird of every sort.7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of allflesh, wherein is the breath of life.7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, asGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the watersincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon theearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all thehigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountainswere covered.7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, andof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was thebreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the faceof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and thefowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noahonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fiftydays.8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all thecattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass overthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deepand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven wasrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earthcontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days thewaters were abated.8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day ofthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in thetenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of themountains seen.8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened thewindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from offthe earth.8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters wereabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no restfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, forthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth hishand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth thedove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew thatthe waters were abated from off the earth.8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;which returned not again unto him any more.8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in thefirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up fromoff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of themonth, was the earth dried.8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, ofall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in theearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and everyfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, wentforth out of the ark.8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every cleanbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on thealtar.8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in hisheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; forthe imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will Iagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold andheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Befruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beastof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that movethupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand arethey delivered.9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as thegreen herb have I given you all things.9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shallye not eat.9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand ofevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand ofevery man's brother will I require the life of man.9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for inthe image of God made he man.9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly inthe earth, and multiply therein.9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 AndI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed afteryou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of thefowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; fromall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall allflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shallthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I makebetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, forperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shallbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember mycovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of allflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy allflesh.9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, thatI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every livingcreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, whichI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, andHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earthoverspread.9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncoveredwithin his tent.9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,and told his two brethren without.9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both theirshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of theirfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father'snakedness.9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son haddone unto him.9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he beunto his brethren.9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall behis servant.9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents ofShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: andhe died.10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, andJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, andTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, andDodanim.10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, andAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and thecity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:the same is a great city.10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) andCaphtorim.10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And theJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and theZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of theCanaanites spread abroad.10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comestto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, andAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after theirtongues, in their countries, and in their nations.10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, thebrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,and Aram.10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; forin his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, andJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, andAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all thesewere the sons of Joktan.10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar amount of the east.10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after theirtongues, in their lands, after their nations.10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after theirgenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations dividedin the earth after the flood.11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that theyfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burnthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they formorter.11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whosetop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we bescattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which thechildren of men builded.11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have allone language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will berestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, thatthey may not understand one another's speech.11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face ofall the earth: and they left off to build the city.11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD didthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did theLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred yearsold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shemlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons anddaughters.11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,and begat sons and daughters.11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salahlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sonsand daughters.11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 AndEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, andbegat sons and daughters.11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleglived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sonsand daughters.11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 AndReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begatsons and daughters.11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Seruglived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons anddaughters.11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,and begat sons and daughters.11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, andHaran.11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of hisnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wifewas Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter ofHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son'sson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and theywent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land ofCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terahdied in Haran.12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that Iwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and Iwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be ablessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse himthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth beblessed.12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot wentwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departedout of Haran.12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and alltheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they hadgotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;and into the land of Canaan they came.12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, untothe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will Igive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, whoappeared unto him.12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the nameof the LORD.12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down intoEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art afair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, whenthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well withme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, theEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her beforePharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, andoxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,and camels.12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plaguesbecause of Sarai Abram's wife.12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hastdone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me towife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent himaway, and his wife, and all that he had.13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that hehad, and Lot with him, into the south.13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, untothe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel andHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at thefirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, andtents.13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwelltogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwelltogether.13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle andthe herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzitedwelled then in the land.13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we bebrethren.13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodomand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,as thou comest unto Zoar.13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyedeast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in thecities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORDexceedingly.13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated fromhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou artnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For allthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if aman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also benumbered.13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in thebreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain ofMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king ofnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and withBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king ofZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which isthe salt sea.14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth yearthey rebelled.14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings thatwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and theZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And theHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, andsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, thatdwelt in Hazezontamar.14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale ofSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal kingof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;four kings with five.14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings ofSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fledto the mountain.14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all theirvictuals, and went their way.14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,and his goods, and departed.14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, andbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, hearmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred andeighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, bynight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on theleft hand of Damascus.14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again hisbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return fromthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, atthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: andhe was the priest of the most high God.14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most highGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most highGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave himtithes of all.14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, andtake the goods to thyself.14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine handunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, andthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men haveeaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,and Mamre; let them take their portion.15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in avision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceedinggreat reward.15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I gochildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,one born in my house is mine heir.15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Thisshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine ownbowels shall be thine heir.15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towardheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and hesaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him forrighteousness.15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Urof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inheritit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and aturtledove, and a young pigeon.15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove themaway.15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall bea stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; andthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also thatnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall theycome out with great substance.15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buriedin a good old age.15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: forthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it wasdark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed betweenthose pieces.15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto thegreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and theKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and thePerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and theCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had anhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrainedme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I mayobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, afterAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to herhusband Abram to be his wife.16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she sawthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given mymaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I wasdespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; doto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, shefled from her face.16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in thewilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whitherwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,and submit thyself under her hands.16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thyseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art withchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; becausethe LORD hath heard thy affliction.16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presenceof all his brethren.16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, ThouGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him thatseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,it is between Kadesh and Bered.16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,which Hagar bare, Ishmael.16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bareIshmael to Abram.17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appearedto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,and be thou perfect.17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and willmultiply thee exceedingly.17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be afather of many nations.17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy nameshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nationsof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seedafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be aGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the landwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for aneverlasting possession; and I will be their God.17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you andthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shallbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, orbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thymoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in yourflesh for an everlasting covenant.17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin isnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hathbroken my covenant.17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt notcall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, Iwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peopleshall be of her.17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in hisheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abrahamsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And Godsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt callhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for aneverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessedhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shallbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in hishouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among themen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin inthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael hisson.17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought withmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he satin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyesand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, heran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward theground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thysight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a littlewater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselvesunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfortye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye cometo your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Makeready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakesupon the hearth.18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and theydid eat.18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,Behold, in the tent.18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to thetime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarahheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and itceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxedold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORDsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of asurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard forthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according tothe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: andAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which Ido; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mightynation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and hishousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to dojustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that whichhe hath spoken of him.18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah isgreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go downnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry ofit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towardSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy therighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fiftyrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare theplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be farfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with thewicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be farfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 Andthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,then I will spare all the place for their sakes.18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon meto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thoudestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find thereforty and five, I will not destroy it.18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure thereshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty'ssake.18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I willspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, Iwill not do it, if I find thirty there.18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, Iwill not destroy it for twenty's sake.18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yetbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, Iwill not destroy it for ten's sake.18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing withAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in thegate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowedhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarryall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go onyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street allnight.19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bakeunleavened bread, and they did eat.19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men ofSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the peoplefrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them outunto us, that we may know them.19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door afterhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; letme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is goodin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came theyunder the shadow of my roof.19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellowcame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we dealworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,even Lot, and came near to break the door.19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the houseto them, and shut to the door.19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house withblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves tofind the door.19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son inlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in thecity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy thisplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of theLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which marriedhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORDwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sonsin law.19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and uponthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORDbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set himwithout the city.19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither staythou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thymercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannotescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shalllive.19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning thisthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thouhast spoken.19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thoube come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone andfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and thatwhich grew upon the ground.19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became apillar of salt.19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where hestood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smokeof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of theoverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and histwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dweltin a cave, he and his two daughters.19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, andthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner ofall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and wewill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and thefirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not whenshe lay down, nor when she arose.19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said untothe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make himdrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that wemay preserve seed of our father.19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and theyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she laydown, nor when she arose.19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: thesame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his nameBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto thisday.20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, anddwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: andAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;for she is a man's wife.20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thouslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is mysister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in theintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didstthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee fromsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, andhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore hernot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that arethine.20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all hisservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men weresore afraid.20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thoudone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought onme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me thatought not to be done.20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thouhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me formy wife's sake.20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of myfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from myfather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thoushalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,He is my brother.20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, andwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah hiswife.20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell whereit pleaseth thee.20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother athousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of theeyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she wasreproved.20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and hiswife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house ofAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did untoSarah as he had spoken.21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, atthe set time of which God had spoken to him.21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, asGod had commanded him.21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was bornunto him.21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hearwill laugh with me.21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah shouldhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a greatfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had bornunto Abraham, mocking.21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and herson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, evenwith Isaac.21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because ofhis son.21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sightbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarahhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thyseed be called.21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,because he is thy seed.21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and abottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered inthe wilderness of Beersheba.21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the childunder one of the shrubs.21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of thechild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God calledto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I willmake him a great nation.21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and shewent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in thewilderness, and became an archer.21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took hima wife out of the land of Egypt.21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol thechief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with theein all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by Godthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with myson's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, whichAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neitherdidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;and both of them made a covenant.21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambswhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these sevenewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness untome, that I have digged this well.21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there theysware both of them.21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into theland of the Philistines.21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there onthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did temptAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thoulovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there fora burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clavethe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the placeof which God had told him.22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw theplace afar off.22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it uponIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and theywent both of them together.22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: andhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, Myson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so theywent both of them together.22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abrahambuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac hisson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slayhis son.22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, andsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thouany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thouhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behindhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and tookthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of hisson.22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it issaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven thesecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and inmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, andas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possessthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nationsof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up andwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was toldAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thybrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, andKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,Abraham's brother.22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: thesewere the years of the life of Sarah.23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land ofCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto thesons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury mydead out of my sight.23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice ofour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee hissepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of theland, even to the children of Heth.23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that Ishould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me toEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave ofMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for asmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of aburyingplace amongst you.23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron theHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, evenof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, mylord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, Igive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:bury thy dead.23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of theland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I willgive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my deadthere.23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephronthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was beforeMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the treesthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, weremade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of thechildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of thefield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land ofCanaan.23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure untoAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD hadblessed Abraham in all things.24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruledover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the Godof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of thedaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shaltgo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my sonIsaac.24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not bewilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son againunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said untohim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, andfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swareunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall sendhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son fromthence.24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thoushalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham hismaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, anddeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and hearose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a wellof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go outto draw water.24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, sendme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters ofthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come topass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, Ipray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will givethy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointedfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewedkindness unto my master.24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife ofNahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither hadany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled herpitcher, and came up.24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,drink a little water of thy pitcher.24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down herpitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will drawwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ranagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether theLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that theman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two braceletsfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whosedaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father'shouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am thedaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provenderenough, and room to lodge in.24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, whohath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I beingin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house thesethings.24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ranout unto the man, unto the well.24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets uponhis sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,behold, he stood by the camels at the well.24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; whereforestandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for thecamels.24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, andgave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,and the men's feet that were with him.24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I willnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is becomegreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she wasold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wifeto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, andtake a wife unto my son.24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will notfollow me.24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send hisangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife formy son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thoube clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and ifthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of mymaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, thatwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she sayto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let thesame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master'sson.24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekahcame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down untothe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I praythee.24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,and she made the camels drink also.24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And shesaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessedthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right wayto take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tellme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to theleft.24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedethfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her bethy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard theirwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels ofgold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to herbrother and to her mother precious things.24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,Send me away unto my master.24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide withus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hathprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at hermouth.24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go withthis man? And she said, I will go.24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, andAbraham's servant, and his men.24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art oursister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seedpossess the gate of those which hate them.24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon thecamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and wenthis way.24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dweltin the south country.24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: andhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, shelighted off the camel.24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walkethin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and tookRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac wascomforted after his mother's death.25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, andIshbak, and Shuah.25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan wereAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abrahamgave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,eastward, unto the east country.25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which helived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, anold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave ofMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, whichis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sonsof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessedhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whomHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 Andthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, accordingto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sonsof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by theircastles; twelve princes according to their nations.25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred andthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and wasgathered unto his people.25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, asthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all hisbrethren.25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abrahambegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekahto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sisterto Laban the Syrian.25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she wasbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wifeconceived.25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, Ifit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and twomanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the onepeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shallserve the younger.25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, therewere twins in her womb.25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; andthey called his name Esau.25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold onEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescoreyears old when she bare them.25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of thefield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: butRebekah loved Jacob.25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he wasfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with thatsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profitshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to methis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright untoJacob.25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he dideat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised hisbirthright.26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine thatwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of thePhilistines unto Gerar.26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in thisland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, andunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform theoath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thyseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seedall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of theearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and keptmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked himof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, Sheis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me forRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, thatAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she isthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said untohim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one ofthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldesthave brought guiltiness upon us.26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheththis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year anhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until hebecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, andpossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistinesenvied him.26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in thedays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, andfilled them with earth.26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art muchmightier than we.26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley ofGerar, and dwelt there.26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had diggedin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stoppedthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after thenames by which his father had called them.26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there awell of springing water.26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;because they strove with him.26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and hecalled the name of it Sitnah.26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and forthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and hesaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitfulin the land.26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I amthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and willbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of theLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged awell.26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of hisfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing yehate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We sawcertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be nowan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make acovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have nottouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and havesent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one toanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him inpeace.26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said untohim, We have found water.26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city isBeersheba unto this day.26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith thedaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon theHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes weredim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and saidunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of mydeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiverand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that Imay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau wentto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thyfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, andmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORDbefore my death.27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which Icommand thee.27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids ofthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such ashe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he mayeat, and that he may bless thee before his death.27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother isa hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure willfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring acurse upon me, and not a blessing.27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: onlyobey my voice, and go fetch me them.27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: andhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, whichwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meatand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto hisfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badestme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul maybless me.27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found itso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought itto me.27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I mayfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, andsaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as hisbrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son'svenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,my son.27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell ofhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is asthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore Godgive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, andplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bowdown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bowdown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be hethat blesseth thee.27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end ofblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence ofIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto hisfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of hisson's venison, that thy soul may bless me.27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, Iam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is hethat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of allbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall beblessed.27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with agreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,even me also, O my father.27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken awaythy blessing.27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hathsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou notreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said untoEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have Igiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustainedhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau saidunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, evenme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thydwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heavenfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt servethy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have thedominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith hisfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourningfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: andshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing tokill thee.27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Labanmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thybrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn awayfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I willsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of youboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of mylife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of thedaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of theland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, andblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take awife of the daughters of Canaan.28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother'sfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thymother's brother.28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiplythee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give theethe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thoumayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gaveunto Abraham.28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau'smother.28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away toPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed himhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of thedaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and hismother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that thedaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esauunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath thedaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be hiswife.28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there allnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of thatplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place tosleep.28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and thetop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascendingand descending on it.28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORDGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thouliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seedshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to thewest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in theeand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all placeswhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for Iwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken tothee of.28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORDis in this place; and I knew it not.28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this isnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone thathe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oilupon the top of it.28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name ofthat city was called Luz at the first.28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and willkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, andraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house inpeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which Ihave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thoushalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of thepeople of the east.29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, therewere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well theywatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled thestone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stoneagain upon the well's mouth in his place.29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And theysaid, Of Haran are we.29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And theysaid, We know him.29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that thecattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go andfeed them.29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gatheredtogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then wewater the sheep.29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father'ssheep; for she kept them.29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Labanhis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, andwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and thathe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob hissister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissedhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. Andhe abode with him the space of a month.29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thywages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elderwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and wellfavoured.29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven yearsfor Rachel thy younger daughter.29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than thatI should give her to another man: abide with me.29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed untohim but a few days, for the love he had to her.29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days arefulfilled, that I may go in unto her.29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made afeast.29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah hisdaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for anhandmaid.29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not Iserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to givethe younger before the firstborn.29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the servicewhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachelhis daughter to wife also.29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to beher maid.29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel morethan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:but Rachel was barren.29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his nameReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;now therefore my husband will love me.29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because theLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:and she called his name Simeon.29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this timewill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:therefore was his name called Levi.29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now willI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and leftbearing.30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachelenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else Idie.30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am Iin God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and sheshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went inunto her.30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard myvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a secondson.30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with mysister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah hermaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call meblessed: and she called his name Asher.30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and foundmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. ThenRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast takenmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? AndRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son'smandrakes.30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah wentout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely Ihave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her thatnight.30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacobthe fifth son.30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have givenmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will myhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and shecalled his name Zebulun.30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and openedher womb.30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken awaymy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORDshall add to me another son.30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacobsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, andto my country.30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour inthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hathblessed me for thy sake.30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, andhow thy cattle was with me.30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is nowincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since mycoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt notgive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will againfeed and keep thy flock.30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thenceall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle amongthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of suchshall be my hire.30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when itshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckledand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall becounted stolen with me.30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thyword.30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked andspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, andevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among thesheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: andJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel andchesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the whiteappear which was in the rods.30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in thegutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, thatthey should conceive when they came to drink.30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forthcattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of theflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock ofLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not untoLaban's cattle.30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle didconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle inthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so thefeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, andmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath takenaway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father'shath he gotten all this glory.31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it wasnot toward him as before.31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thyfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto hisflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, thatit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been withme.31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;but God suffered him not to hurt me.31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all thecattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall bethy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and giventhem to me.31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, thatI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams whichleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:And I said, Here am I.31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams whichleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for Ihave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, andwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from thisland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet anyportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we notcounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devouredalso our money.31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that isours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said untothee, do.31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which hehad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten inPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen theimages that were her father's.31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that hetold him not that he fled.31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed overthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him sevendays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and saidunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in themount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou haststolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captivestaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sentthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thouhast now done foolishly in so doing.31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God ofyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed thatthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sorelongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen mygods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I wasafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thydaughters from me.31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: beforeour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and intothe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he outof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel'sfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, butfound them not.31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that Icannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And hesearched but found not the images.31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answeredand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hastso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all mystuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it herebefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt usboth.31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I noteaten.31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I barethe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen byday, or stolen by night.31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost bynight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served theefourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:and thou hast changed my wages ten times.31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear ofIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. Godhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked theeyesternight.31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are mydaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are mycattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this dayunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; andlet it be for a witness between me and thee.31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they tookstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee thisday.Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for hesaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one fromanother.31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take otherwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witnessbetwixt me and thee.31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold thispillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap bewitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over thisheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and thispillar unto me, for harm.31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of theirfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his fatherIsaac.31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called hisbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all nightin the mount.31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons andhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned untohis place.32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and hecalled the name of that place Mahanaim.32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto theland of Seir, the country of Edom.32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lordEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, andstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, andmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, thatI may find grace in thy sight.32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thybrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred menwith him.32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided thepeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, andsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my fatherIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and tothy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy ofthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hastshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;and now I am become two bands.32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from thehand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and themother with the children.32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seedas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which cameto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred shegoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,twenty she asses, and ten foals.32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every droveby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, andput a space betwixt drove and drove.32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brothermeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whithergoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shaltsay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lordEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all thatfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,when ye find him.32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. Forhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, andafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged thatnight in the company.32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his twowomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent overthat he had.32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with himuntil the breaking of the day.32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touchedthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out ofjoint, as he wrestled with him.32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, Iwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hastprevailed.32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And heblessed him there.32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seenGod face to face, and my life is preserved.32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and hehalted upon his thigh.32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew whichshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: becausehe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leahand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the groundseven times, until he came near to his brother.33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,and kissed him: and they wept.33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which Godhath graciously given thy servant.33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and theybowed themselves.33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? Andhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hastunto thyself.33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace inthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I haveseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wastpleased with me.33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; becauseGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And heurged him, and he took it.33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I willgo before thee.33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children aretender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if menshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and Iwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me andthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk thatare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in thesight of my lord.33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and madebooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is calledSuccoth.33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in theland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tentbefore the city.33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundredpieces of money.33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, wentout to see the daughters of the land.34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of thecountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he lovedthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me thisdamsel to wife.34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now hissons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace untilthey were come.34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to communewith him.34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he hadwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thingought not to be done.34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechemlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,and take our daughters unto you.34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let mefind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give accordingas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his fatherdeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give oursister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,that every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give ourdaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we willdwell with you, and we will become one people.34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then willwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he haddelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all thehouse of his father.34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,and communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men arepeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and tradetherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let ustake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them ourdaughters.34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they arecircumcised.34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast oftheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwellwith us.34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that wentout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all thatwent out of the gate of his city.34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, thattwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took eachman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of thesword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,because they had defiled their sister.34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and thatwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And alltheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took theycaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to makeme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanitesand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gatherthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,I and my house.34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thoufleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were withhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, andchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; andI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of mydistress, and was with me in the way which I went.35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in theirhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hidthem under the oak which was by Shechem.35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the citiesthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons ofJacob.35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of hisbrother.35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneathBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,and blessed him.35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not becalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called hisname Israel.35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful andmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, andkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gaveAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after theewill I give the land.35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and hepoured oil thereon.35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,Bethel.35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little wayto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that themidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for shedied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called himBenjamin.35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which isBethlehem.35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar ofRachel's grave unto this day.35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower ofEdar.35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reubenwent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, andZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And thesons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And thesons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons ofJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the cityof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto hispeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buriedhim.36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughterof Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughterof Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister ofNebajoth.36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 AndAholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons ofEsau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and allthe persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and allhis substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went intothe country from the face of his brother Jacob.36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them becauseof their cattle.36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomitesin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz theson of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife ofEsau.36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, andKenaz.36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare toEliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, andMizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah thedaughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, andJaalam, and Korah.36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz thefirstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukesthat came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, dukeZerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came ofReuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau'swife.36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamahthe daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are theirdukes.36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer,and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seirin the land of Edom.36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan'ssister was Timna.36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, andEbal, Shepho, and Onam.36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: thiswas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed theasses of Zibeon his father.36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah thedaughter of Anah.36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, andIthran, and Cheran.36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.36:28 The children of Dishan are these;

and his wife's name wasMehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,according to their families, after their places, by their names; dukeTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,duke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 DukeMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to theirhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father ofthe Edomites.37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, inthe land of Canaan.37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen yearsold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with thesons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: andJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because hewas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more thanall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably untohim.37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and theyhated him yet the more.37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I havedreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheavesstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? orshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet themore for his dreams, and for his words.37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, andsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun andthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and hisfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thouhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come tobow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethrenenvied him; but his father observed the saying.37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flockin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,Here am I.37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well withthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So hesent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering inthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feedtheir flocks.37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and foundthem in Dothan.37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near untothem, they conspired against him to slay him.37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into somepit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shallsee what will become of his dreams.37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;and said, Let us not kill him.37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into thispit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he mightrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours thatwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and thepit was empty, there was no water in it.37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyesand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gileadwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carryit down to Egypt.37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slayour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell himto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is ourbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew andlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelitesfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not inthe pit; and he rent his clothes.37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;and I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, andkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 Andthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to theirfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son'scoat or no.37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beasthath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,and mourned for his son many days.37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down intothe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officerof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from hisbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose namewas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his nameOnan.38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his nameShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;and the LORD slew him.38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, andmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came topass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it onthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore heslew him also.38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow atthy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lestperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went anddwelt in her father's house.38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers toTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth upto Timnath to shear his sheep.38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered herwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which isby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she wasnot given unto him to wife.38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because shehad covered her face.38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughterin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest comein unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave ither, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, andput on the garments of her widowhood.38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is theharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was noharlot in this place.38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and alsothe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was toldJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; andalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring herforth, and let her be burnt.38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, andstaff.38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been morerighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And heknew her again no more.38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,twins were in her womb.38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put outhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarletthread, saying, This came out first.38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, hisbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? thisbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet threadupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer ofPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands ofthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and hewas in the house of his master the Egyptian.39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORDmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and hemade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into hishand.39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseerin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed theEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD wasupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew notought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodlyperson, and well favoured.39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wifecast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, mymaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committedall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this housethan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, becausethou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sinagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day byday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into thehouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the housethere within.39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and heleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garmentin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men ofher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in anHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and Icried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard thatI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, andfled, and got him out.39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, TheHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me tomock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,that he left his garment with me, and fled out.39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of hiswife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thyservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, aplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in theprison.39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave himfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all theprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, hewas the doer of it.39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was underhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, theLORD made it to prosper.40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of theking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against thechief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and heserved them: and they continued a season in ward.40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in onenight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, thebutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in theprison.40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked uponthem, and, behold, they were sad.40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward ofhis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 Andthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is nointerpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretationsbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine werethree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shotforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 AndPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed theminto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: Thethree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shallPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thoushalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former mannerwhen thou wast his butler.40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shewkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away outof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing thatthey should put me into the dungeon.40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, hesaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had threewhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there wasof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them outof the basket upon my head.40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretationthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three daysshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on atree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the headof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; andhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chiefbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaohdreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favouredkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of theriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine uponthe brink of the river.41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the sevenwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven earsof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east windsprung up after them.41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all thewise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was nonethat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remembermy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and putme in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chiefbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamedeach man according to the interpretation of his dream.41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant tothe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to usour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me herestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought himhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed hisraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and thereis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thoucanst understand a dream to interpret it.41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shallgive Pharaoh an answer of peace.41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood uponthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of theriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in ameadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poorand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all theland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favouredkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they hadeaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; butthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in onestalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And thethin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto themagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: Godhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears areseven years: the dream is one.41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after themare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east windshall be seven years of famine.41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God isabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout allthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven yearsof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall notbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shallbe very grievous.41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it isbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring itto pass.41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, andset him over the land of Egypt.41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteousyears.41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food inthe cities.41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the sevenyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the landperish not through the famine.41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyesof all his servants.41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one asthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh saidunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is noneso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in thethrone will I be greater than thou.41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all theland of Egypt.41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it uponJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put agold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the secondchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and hemade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without theeshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gavehim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. AndJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaohking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, andwent throughout all the land of Egypt.41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth byhandfuls.41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which werein the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food ofthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,until he left numbering; for it was without number.41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of faminecame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare untohim.41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hathcaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land ofEgypt, were ended.41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Josephhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land ofEgypt there was bread.41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried toPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go untoJoseph; what he saith to you, do.41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Josephopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and thefamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;because that the famine was so sore in all lands.42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said untohis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, andbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:for the famine was in the land of Canaan.42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was thatsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, andbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himselfstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, andsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye arecome.42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thyservants come.42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are nospies.42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the landye are come.42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of oneman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day withour father, and one is not.42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life ofPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother comehither.42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall bekept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be anytruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; forI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be boundin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of yourhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall yourwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerningour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besoughtus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,behold, also his blood is required.42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake untothem by an interpreter.42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned tothem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, andbound him before their eyes.42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and torestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisionfor the way: and thus did he unto them.42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender inthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, itis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, andtold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is thelord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of thecountry.42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 Webe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngestis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shallI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye areno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you yourbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they andtheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of mychildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjaminaway: all these things are against me.42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if Ibring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring himto thee again.42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brotheris dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way inthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow tothe grave.43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which theyhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buyus a little food.43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protestunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be withyou.43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buythee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except yourbrother be with you.43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tellthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The manasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is yourfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him accordingto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he wouldsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel hisfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we maylive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if Ibring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear theblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we hadreturned this second time.43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, dothis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carrydown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, andmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carryit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Takealso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And GodAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away yourother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I ambereaved.43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money intheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, andstood before Joseph.43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler ofhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for thesemen shall dine with me at noon.43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men intoJoseph's house.43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph'shouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in oursacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasionagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and theycommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, wecame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came topass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in fullweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God ofyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.And he brought Simeon out unto them.43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave themwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: forthey heard that they should eat bread there.43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present whichwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to theearth.43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your fatherwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And theyanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, hismother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spakeunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon hisbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,and wept there.43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, andsaid, Set on bread.43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: becausethe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is anabomination unto the Egyptians.43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to hisbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the menmarvelled one at another.43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: butBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And theydrank, and were merry with him.44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men'ssacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's moneyin his sack's mouth.44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of theyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word thatJoseph had spoken.44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, theyand their asses.44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thoudost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil forgood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and wherebyindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? Godforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we broughtagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we stealout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thyservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord'sbondmen.44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: hewith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,and opened every man his sack.44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at theyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, andreturned to the city.44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he wasyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judahsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or howshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thyservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also withwhom the cup is found.44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man inwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,get you up in peace unto your father.44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thyservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let notthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or abrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an oldman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother isdead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, thatI may set mine eyes upon him.44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: forif he should leave his father, his father would die.44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brothercome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,we told him the words of my lord.44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be withus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, exceptour youngest brother be with us.44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wifebare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if yetake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring downmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the ladbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not withus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairsof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame tomy father for ever.44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of thelad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stoodby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And therestood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto hisbrethren.45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaohheard.45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my fatheryet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they weretroubled at his presence.45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom yesold into Egypt.45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that yesold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yetthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing norharvest.45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in theearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hathmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a rulerthroughout all the land of Egypt.45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saiththy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,tarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thoushalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children'schildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of allthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; andBenjamin wept upon his neck.45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: andafter that his brethren talked with him.45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and hisservants.45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 Andtake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I willgive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat ofthe land.45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of theland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring yourfather, and come.45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land ofEgypt is your's.45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision forthe way.45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but toBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes ofraiment.45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses ladenwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn andbread and meat for his father by the way.45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he saidunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaanunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yetalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob'sheart fainted, for he believed them not.45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had saidunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carryhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him beforeI die.46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came toBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go downinto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I willgo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee upagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carriedJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in thewagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they hadgotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all hisseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, hisdaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he withhim into Egypt.46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, andCarmi.46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, andZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons ofPharez were Hezron and Hamul.46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, andShimron.46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob inPadanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and hisdaughters were thirty and three.46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,and Arodi, and Areli.46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah hisdaughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh andEphraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bareunto him.46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all thesouls were fourteen.46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, andShillem.46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel hisdaughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out ofhis loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescoreand six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came intoEgypt, were threescore and ten.46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his faceunto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israelhis father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell onhis neck, and wept on his neck a good while.46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seenthy face, because thou art yet alive.46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and myfather's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feedcattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and allthat they have.46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, andshall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thyservants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land ofGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and mybrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the landof Goshen.47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presentedthem unto Pharaoh.47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? Andthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and alsoour fathers.47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are wecome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for thefamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, letthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thybrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; inthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in theland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activityamong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him beforePharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacobsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are anhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years ofmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of thelife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them apossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the landof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all hisfather's household, with bread, according to their families.47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was verysore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted byreason of the famine.47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the landof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land ofCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for yourcattle, if money fail.47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave thembread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattleof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for alltheir cattle for that year.47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that ourmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is notought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servantsunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, thatthe land be not desolate.47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for theEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed overthem: so the land became Pharaoh's.47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end ofthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests hada portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion whichPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you thisday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shallsow the land.47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall givethe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, forseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,and for food for your little ones.47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace inthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of thepriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multipliedexceedingly.47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so thewhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called hisson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and trulywith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie withmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in theirburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israelbowed himself upon the bed's head.48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,Manasseh and Ephraim.48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh untothee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luzin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of theea multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after theefor an everlasting possession.48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born untothee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, aremine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,and shall be called after the name of their brethren in theirinheritance.48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in theland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to comeunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the sameis Bethlehem.48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath givenme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and Iwill bless them.48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could notsee.And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embracedthem.48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowedhimself with his face to the earth.48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towardIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel'sright hand, and brought them near unto him.48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it uponEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh'shead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathersAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long untothis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless thelads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathersAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst ofthe earth.48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon thehead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this isthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but trulyhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shallbecome a multitude of nations.48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israelbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he setEphraim before Manasseh.48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall bewith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with mybow.49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselvestogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the lastdays.49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; andhearken unto Israel your father.49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of mystrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up tothy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in theirhabitations.49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for itwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shallbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow downbefore thee.49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shallrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor alawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shallthe gathering of the people be.49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto thechoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in theblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teethwhite with milk.49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be foran haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it waspleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant untotribute.49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, thatbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at thelast.49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royaldainties.49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorelygrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abodein strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the handsof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone ofIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; andby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, andof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed abovethe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of theeverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on thecrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devourthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it thattheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according tohis blessing he blessed them.49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gatheredunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in thefield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field ofMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abrahambought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of aburyingplace.49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buriedIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein wasfrom the children of Heth.49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, hegathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and wasgathered unto his people.50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, andkissed him.50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm hisfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled thedays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for himthreescore and ten days.50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake untothe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father mademe swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me inthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me goup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as hemade thee swear.50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up allthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the eldersof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and hisbrethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and theirflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it wasa very great company.50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyondJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:and he made a mourning for his father seven days.50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw themourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourningto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,which is beyond Jordan.50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him inthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with thefield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, beforeMamre.50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and allthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried hisfather.50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, theysaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite usall the evil which we did unto him.50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father didcommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive thetrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph weptwhen they spake unto him.50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; andthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place ofGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meantit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much peoplealive.50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your littleones.And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: andJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: thechildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up uponJoseph's knees.50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surelyvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swareto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, Godwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and theyembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.The Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, andBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventysouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increasedabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the landwas filled with them.1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children ofIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wiselywith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when therefalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fightagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them withtheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom andRaamses.1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied andgrew.And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve withrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, inmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: alltheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which thename of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 Andhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, andsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: butif it be a daughter, then she shall live.1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egyptcommanded them, but saved the men children alive.1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said untothem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men childrenalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrewwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and aredelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the peoplemultiplied, and waxed very mighty.1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that hemade them houses.1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that isborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall savealive.2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife adaughter of Levi.2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him thathe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark ofbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the childtherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at theriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when shesaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, thebabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of theHebrews' children.2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call tothee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child forthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid wentand called the child's mother.2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, andnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women tookthe child, and nursed it.2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,Because I drew him out of the water.2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that hewent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spiedan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that therewas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of theHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee aprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thoukilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thingis known.2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. ButMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:and he sat down by a well.2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came anddrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood upand helped them, and watered their flock.2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it thatye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian deliveredus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough forus, and watered the flock.2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it thatye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave MosesZipporah his daughter.2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for hesaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egyptdied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, andthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenantwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respectunto them.3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priestof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, andcame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire outof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burnedwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,why the bush is not burnt.3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called untohim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,Here am I.3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thyfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for hewas afraid to look upon God.3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my peoplewhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of theirtaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down todeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowingwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and theHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, andthe Jebusites.3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is comeunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptiansoppress them.3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thoumayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be atoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forththe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children ofIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent meunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I sayunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent meunto you.3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto thechildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this ismy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and ofJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seenthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bringyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and theHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thouand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall sayunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let usgo, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that wemay sacrifice to the LORD our God.3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, notby a mighty hand.3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all mywonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he willlet you go.3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her thatsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, andraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon yourdaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believeme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath notappeared unto thee.4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And hesaid, A rod.4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it bythe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became arod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of theirfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,hath appeared unto thee.4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand intothy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took itout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put hishand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neitherhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe thevoice of the latter sign.4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these twosigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of thewater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water whichthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but Iam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or whomaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I theLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teachthee what thou shalt say.4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of himwhom thou wilt send.4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeththee, he will be glad in his heart.4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and Iwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what yeshall do.4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to himinstead of God.4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shaltdo signs.4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and saidunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren whichare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said toMoses, Go in peace.4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:for all the men are dead which sought thy life.4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God inhis hand.4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return intoEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I haveput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not letthe people go.4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel ismy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I willslay thy son, even thy firstborn.4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,and sought to kill him.4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of herson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband artthou to me.4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,because of the circumcision.4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,and all the signs which he had commanded him.4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders ofthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which theLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of thepeople.4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD hadvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon theiraffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thussaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold afeast unto me in the wilderness.5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice tolet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice untothe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with thesword.5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses andAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, andye make them rest from their burdens.5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,and their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people strawto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw forthemselves.5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, yeshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they beidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labourtherein; and let them not regard vain words.5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will notgive you straw.5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of yourwork shall be diminished.5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land ofEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, yourdaily tasks, as when there was straw.5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh'staskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Whereforehave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israelcame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus withthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, andthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; butthe fault is in thine own people.5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let usgo and do sacrifice to the LORD.5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be givenyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they werein evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from yourbricks of your daily task.5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they cameforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look uponyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in theeyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword intheir hand to slay us.5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hastthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath doneevil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will doto Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with astrong hand shall he drive them out of his land.6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the nameof God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give themthe land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they werestrangers.6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whomthe Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and Iwill bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I willrid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretchedout arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for apeople, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am theLORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of theEgyptians.6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I didswear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will giveit you for an heritage: I am the LORD.6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkenednot unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak untoPharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out ofhis land.6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children ofIsrael have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, whoam of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and untoAaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and untoPharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the landof Egypt.6:14 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reubenthe firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: thesebe the families of Reuben.6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are thefamilies of Simeon.6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to theirgenerations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of thelife of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to theirfamilies.6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and threeyears.6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the familiesof Levi according to their generations.6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and shebare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were anhundred and thirty and seven years.6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister ofNaashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, andIthamar.6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: theseare the families of the Korhites.6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putielto wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathersof the Levites according to their families.6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring outthe children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to theirarmies.6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring outthe children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses inthe land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I amthe LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say untothee.6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcisedlips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD saidunto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thybrother shall be thy prophet.7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brothershall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out ofhis land.7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and mywonders in the land of Egypt.7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my handupon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children ofIsrael, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretchforth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel fromamong them.7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and threeyears old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 WhenPharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: thenthou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,and it shall become a serpent.7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as theLORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, andbefore his servants, and it became a serpent.7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now themagicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with theirenchantments.7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;as the LORD had said.7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, herefuseth to let the people go.7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto thewater; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; andthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hathsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me inthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waterswhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shallstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of theriver.7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, andstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools ofwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be bloodthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and invessels of stone.7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he liftedup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sightof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters thatwere in the river were turned to blood.7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, andthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there wasblood throughout all the land of Egypt.7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: andPharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as theLORD had said.7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he sethis heart to this also.7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water todrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smittenthe river.8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thyborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogsabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thybedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, andupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, andupon all thy servants.8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thinehand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over theponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and thefrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought upfrogs upon the land of Egypt.8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat theLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; andI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreatfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy thefrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the riveronly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according tothy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORDour God.8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, andfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the riveronly.8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried untothe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogsdied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened hisheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thyrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become licethroughout all the land of Egypt.8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and inbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land ofEgypt.8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forthlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; asthe LORD had said.8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, andstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say untohim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will sendswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full ofswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which mypeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thoumayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be.8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of fliesinto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into allthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm offlies.8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,sacrifice to your God in the land.8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrificethe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall wesacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and willthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into thewilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to theLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:intreat for me.8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreatthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from hisservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh dealdeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to theLORD.8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removedthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from hispeople; there remained not one.8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither wouldhe let the people go.9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that theymay serve me.9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, andupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and thecattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is thechildren's of Israel.9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORDshall do this thing in the land.9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle ofEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle ofthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didnot let the people go.9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfulsof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavenin the sight of Pharaoh.9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shallbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,throughout all the land of Egypt.9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; andMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breakingforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of theboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all theEgyptians.9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened notunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, andstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of theHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, andupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know thatthere is none like me in all the earth.9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thypeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for toshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout allthe earth.9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wiltnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will causeit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt sincethe foundation thereof even until now.9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hastin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in thefield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down uponthem, and they shall die.9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaohmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And hethat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and hiscattle in the field.9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand towardheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, andupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land ofEgypt.9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORDsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and theLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since itbecame a nation.9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that wasin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of thefield, and brake every tree of the field.9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,was there no hail.9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said untothem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and mypeople are wicked.9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mightythunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay nolonger.9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, Iwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shallcease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know howthat the earth is the LORD's.9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yetfear the LORD God.9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was inthe ear, and the flax was bolled.9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were notgrown up.9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroadhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and therain was not poured upon the earth.9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunderswere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and hisservants.9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let thechildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I havehardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shewthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the earsof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that Iam the LORD.10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thussaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humblethyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow willI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the faceof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shalleat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto youfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out ofthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of allthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thyfathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that theywere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went outfrom Pharaoh.10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man bea snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD theirGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses andAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 AndMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sonsand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I willlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that yedid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over theland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land ofEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hathleft.10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, andthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all thatnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested inall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them therewere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the landwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all thefruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not anygreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through allthe land of Egypt.10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, Ihave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, andintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this deathonly.10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took awaythe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not onelocust in all the coasts of Egypt.10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not letthe children of Israel go.10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand towardheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, evendarkness which may be felt.10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there wasa thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They sawnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: butall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little onesalso go with you.10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burntofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof beleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; andwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let themgo.10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed tothyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thoushalt die.10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face againno more.11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague moreupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hencealtogether.11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow ofhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver andjewels of gold.11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of theEgyptians.Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in thesight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go outinto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land ofEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon histhrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind themill; and all the firstborn of beasts.11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog movehis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORDdoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow downthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people thatfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out fromPharaoh in a great anger.11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: andthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let thechildren of Israel go out of his land.12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egyptsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: itshall be the first month of the year to you.12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In thetenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 Andif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbournext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: yeshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shallkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the wholeassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two sideposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eatit.12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, andunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast withfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; andthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes onyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:it is the LORD's passover.12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and willsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; andagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses whereye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plagueshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keepit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it afeast by an ordinance for ever.12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day yeshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eatethleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soulshall be cut off from Israel.12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and inthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no mannerof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,that only may be done of you.12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in thisselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by anordinance for ever.12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of themonth at even.12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: forwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cutoff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or bornin the land.12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall yeeat unleavened bread.12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said untothem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, andkill the passover.12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the bloodthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side postswith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out atthe door of his house until the morning.12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and whenhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, theLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer tocome in unto your houses to smite you.12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and tothy sons for ever.12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which theLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keepthis service.12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say untoyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is thesacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of thechildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, anddelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD hadcommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all thefirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that saton his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in thedungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, andall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there wasnot a house where there was not one dead.12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children ofIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and begone; and bless me also.12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they mightsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, theirkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels ofgold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in thesight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things asthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, andherds, even very much cattle.12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they broughtforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrustout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared forthemselves any victual.12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt inEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirtyyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts ofthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringingthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to beobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance ofthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But everyman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcisedhim, then shall he eat thereof.12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth oughtof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bonethereof.12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep thepassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then lethim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in theland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the strangerthat sojourneth among you.12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Mosesand Aaron, so did they.12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bringthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me allthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children ofIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which yecame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength ofhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavenedbread be eaten.13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land ofthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, aland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service inthis month.13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventhday shall be a feast to the LORD.13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall noleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seenwith thee in all thy quarters.13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is donebecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out ofEgypt.13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for amemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from yearto year.13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land ofthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shallgive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all thatopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast whichthou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; andif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and allthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength ofhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, thatthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both thefirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice tothe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all thefirstborn of my children I redeem.13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontletsbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forthout of Egypt.13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, thatGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the peoplerepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God ledthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitlysworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; andye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,in the edge of the wilderness.13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, tolead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give themlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar ofthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before thepeople.14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shallye encamp by the sea.14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They areentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow afterthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; thatthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and theheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go fromserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his peoplewith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all thechariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and hepursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel wentout with an high hand.14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariotsof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook themencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted uptheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and theywere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thoudealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not thisthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that wemay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve theEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, andsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: forthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again nomore for ever.14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 Butlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, anddivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground throughthe midst of the sea.14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, andthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, andupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I havegotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon hishorsemen.14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went frombefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came betweenthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloudand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that theone came not near the other all the night.14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORDcaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, andmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea uponthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their righthand, and on their left.14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midstof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD lookedunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of thecloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took offtheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that theEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORDfighteth for them against the Egyptians.14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over thesea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon theirchariots, and upon their horsemen.14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the seareturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptiansfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst ofthe sea.14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and thehorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea afterthem; there remained not so much as one of them.14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst ofthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, andon their left.14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of theEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon theEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, andhis servant Moses.15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto theLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hathtriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea.15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,and I will exalt him.15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: hischosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as astone.15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy righthand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrownthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, whichconsumed them as stubble.15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gatheredtogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths werecongealed in the heart of the sea.15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide thespoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, myhand shall destroy them.15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sankas lead in the mighty waters.15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thoustretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hastredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holyhabitation.15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold onthe inhabitants of Palestina.15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaanshall melt away.15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thinearm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, OLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain ofthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for theeto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands haveestablished.15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with hishorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of thesea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in themidst of the sea.15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrelin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels andwith dances.15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hathtriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea.15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out intothe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,and found no water.15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the watersof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was calledMarah.15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall wedrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him atree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were madesweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there heproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to thevoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in hissight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all hisstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I havebrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, andthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregationof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which isbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month aftertheir departing out of the land of Egypt.16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmuredagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children ofIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of theLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when wedid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into thiswilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread fromheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rateevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, orno.16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shallprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much asthey gather daily.16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, Ateven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from theland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory ofthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: andwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, Thisshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth yourmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? yourmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of thechildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard yourmurmurings.16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregationof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard themurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At evenye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, andcovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face ofthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on the ground.16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one toanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses saidunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of itevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according tothe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are inhis tents.16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, someless.16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered muchhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; theygathered every man according to his eating.16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of themleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moseswas wroth with them.16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to hiseating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twiceas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of thecongregation came and told Moses.16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that whichye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that whichremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it didnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath untothe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which isthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people onthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep mycommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given youthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of twodays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his placeon the seventh day.16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and itwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafersmade with honey.16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may seethe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I broughtyou forth from the land of Egypt.16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full ofmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for yourgenerations.16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before theTestimony, to be kept.16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until theycame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto theborders of the land of Canaan.16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed fromthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to thecommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was nowater for the people to drink.17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give uswater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye withme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirstedthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to killus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses criedunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they bealmost ready to stone me.17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and takewith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotestthe river, take in thine hand, and go.17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the eldersof Israel.17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, becauseof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted theLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,and fought with Israel in Rephidim.17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fightwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with therod of God in mine hand.17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israelprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put itunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and hishands were steady until the going down of the sun.17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge ofthe sword.17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in abook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly putout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of itJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that theLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard ofall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and thatthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; forhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name ofthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was minehelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses intothe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And hesaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thywife, and her two sons with her.18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and theycame into the tent.18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done untoPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travailthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had doneto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you outof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hathdelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in thething wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering andsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, toeat bread with Moses' father in law before God.18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge thepeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto theevening.18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittestthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning untoeven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the peoplecome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, theycome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make themknow the statutes of God, and his laws.18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thoudoest is not good.18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that iswith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able toperform it thyself alone.18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and Godshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thoumayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach themordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they mustwalk, and the work that they must do.18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, suchas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such overthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers offifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people atall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bringunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it beeasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thoushalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to theirplace in peace.18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and didall that he had said.18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them headsover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers offifties, and rulers of tens.18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes theybrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way intohis own land.19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forthout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wildernessof Sinai.19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desertof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel campedbefore the mount.19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out ofthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, andtell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto theEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you untomyself.19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep mycovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above allpeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me akingdom of priests, and an holy nation.These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children ofIsrael.19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laidbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORDhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the peopleunto the LORD.19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thickcloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believethee for ever.And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctifythem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 Andbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will comedown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touchthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put todeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely bestoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall notlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, andsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:come not at your wives.19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that therewere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, andthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people thatwas in the camp trembled.19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet withGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORDdescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smokeof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louderand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of themount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moseswent up.19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lestthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctifythemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mountSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, andsanctify it.19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shaltcome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and thepeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forthupon them.19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thyGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of thehouse of bondage.20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likenessof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,or that is in the water under the earth.20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for Ithe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of thefathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of themthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that loveme, and keep my commandments.20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for theLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But theseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt notdo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, northy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thygates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore theLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long uponthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.20:13 Thou shalt not kill.20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.20:15 Thou shalt not steal.20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covetthy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor hisox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, andthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when thepeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:but let not God speak with us, lest we die.20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come toprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sinnot.20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto thethick darkness where God was.20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto thechildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you fromheaven.20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye makeunto you gods of gold.20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrificethereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, andthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come untothee, and I will bless thee.20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not buildit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hastpolluted it.20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thynakedness be not discovered thereon.21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and inthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he weremarried, then his wife shall go out with him.21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sonsor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and heshall go out by himself.21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,and my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shallbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, orunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with anaul; and he shall serve him for ever.21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall notgo out as the menservants do.21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nationhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with herafter the manner of daughters.21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her dutyof marriage, shall he not diminish.21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go outfree without money.21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put todeath.21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay himwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surelyput to death.21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be foundin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely beput to death.21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If herise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smotehim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shallcause him to be thoroughly healed.21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and hedie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not bepunished: for he is his money.21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruitdepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surelypunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and heshall pay as the judges determine.21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of hismaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant'stooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shallbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner ofthe ox shall be quit.21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, andit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, butthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and hisowner also shall be put to death.21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give forthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, accordingto this judgment shall it be done unto him.21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shallgive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall bestoned.21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, andnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of thepit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and thedead beast shall be his.21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shallsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox alsothey shall divide.21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; andthe dead shall be his own.22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,there shall no blood be shed for him.22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shallbe sold for his theft.22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it beox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shallput in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the bestof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he makerestitution.22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks ofcorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; hethat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, lethim pay double.22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall bebrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto hisneighbour's goods.22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, forsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which anotherchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before thejudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double untohis neighbour.22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or asheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,no man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between themboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; andthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto theowner thereof.22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, andhe shall not make good that which was torn.22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, ordie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make itgood.22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie withher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall paymoney according to the dowry of virgins.22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, heshall be utterly destroyed.22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye werestrangers in the land of Egypt.22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, Iwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and Iwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and yourchildren fatherless.22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon himusury.22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thoushalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For thatis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall hesleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I willhear; for I am gracious.22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thypeople.22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, andof thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt giveit me.22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any fleshthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with thewicked to be an unrighteous witness.23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thouspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neithershalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shaltsurely bring it back to him again.23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under hisburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help withhim.23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteousslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, andperverteth the words of the righteous.23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart ofa stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in thefruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest andlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leavethe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal withthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thoushalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thyhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: andmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard outof thy mouth.23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eatunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the timeappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: andnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: andthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thouhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before theLORD God.23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavenedbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring intothe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in hismother's milk.23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he willnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that Ispeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversaryunto thine adversaries.23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto theAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor doafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quitebreak down their images.23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thybread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst ofthee.23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thyland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the peopleto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn theirbacks unto thee.23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out theHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest theland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply againstthee.23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,until thou be increased, and inherit the land.23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea ofthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I willdeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;

that there be no plague among them, when thounumberest them.30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that arenumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekelis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twentyyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give lessthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to makean atonement for your souls.30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children ofIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israelbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt alsomake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: andthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and thealtar, and thou shalt put water therein.30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feetthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come nearto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they dienot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and tohis seed throughout their generations.30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou alsounto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and ofsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, andof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassiafive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oilolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, anointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holyanointing oil.30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregationtherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and allhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar ofincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,and the laver and his foot.30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Thisshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye makeany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and itshall be holy unto you.30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any ofit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with purefrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thoushalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,tempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of itvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle ofthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto youmost holy.30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not maketo yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be untothee holy for the LORD.30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shalleven be cut off from his people.31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called byname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and inunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and inbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving oftimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son ofAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wisehearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I havecommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the arkof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all thefurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, andthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and thelaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holygarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, tominister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, andsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I havecommanded thee shall they do.31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou alsounto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; thatye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoeverdoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among hispeople.31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath ofrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,he shall surely be put to death.31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, toobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetualcovenant.31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: forin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day herested, and was refreshed.31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communingwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,written with the finger of God.32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out ofthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, andsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as forthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, wewot not what is become of him.32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, whichare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,and bring them unto me.32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were intheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with agraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, Thesebe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaronmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burntofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eatand to drink, and rose up to play.32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corruptedthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which Icommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshippedit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, OIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:and I will make of thee a great nation.32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doththy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forthout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief didhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume themfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent ofthis evil against thy people.32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thouswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply yourseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken ofwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do untohis people.32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the twotables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written onboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was thewriting of God, graven upon the tables.32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but thenoise of them that sing do I hear.32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, thathe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and hecast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in thefire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and madethe children of Israel drink of it.32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, thatthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Letnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that theyare set on mischief.32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land ofEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break itoff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there cameout this calf.32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron hadmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 ThenMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'sside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gatheredthemselves together unto him.32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Putevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gatethroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man hiscompanion, and every man his neighbour.32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: andthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestowupon you a blessing this day.32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto thepeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto theLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people havesinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,him will I blot out of my book.32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I havespoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,which Aaron made.33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou andthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, untothe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,Unto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel beforethee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and theHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto aland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst ofthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in theway.33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: andno man did put on him his ornaments.33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children ofIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst ofthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thyornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornamentsby the mount Horeb.33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of thecongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought theLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which waswithout the camp.33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, andlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, thecloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, andthe Lord talked with Moses.33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacledoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tentdoor.33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speakethunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servantJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of thetabernacle.33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring upthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send withme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also foundgrace in my sight.33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace inthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will givethee rest.33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry usnot up hence.33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people havefound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? soshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that areupon the face of the earth.33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also thatthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I knowthee by name.33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and Iwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be graciousto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shewmercy.33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no mansee me, and live.33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thoushalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while myglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, andwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will takeaway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shallnot be seen.34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone likeunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that werein the first tables, which thou brakest.34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning untomount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seenthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed beforethat mount.34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Mosesrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as theLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,and proclaimed the name of the LORD.34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, TheLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant ingoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgivinginiquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clearthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourthgeneration.34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, andworshipped.34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, letmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; andpardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people Iwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor inany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the workof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I driveout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, andthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with theinhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare inthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, breaktheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worshipno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, andthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou takeof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoringafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thoushalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of themonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling amongthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: andif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All thefirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear beforeme empty.34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shaltrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits ofwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before theLORD God, the God of Israel.34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thyborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go upto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left untothe morning.34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring untothe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in hismother's milk.34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for afterthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and withIsrael.34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; hedid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tablesthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai withthe two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from themount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while hetalked with him.34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of thecongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gavethem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mountSinai.34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on hisface.34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, hetook the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake untothe children of Israel that which he was commanded.34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skinof Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,until he went in to speak with him.35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israeltogether, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hathcommanded, that ye should do them.35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shallbe to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doethwork therein shall be put to death.35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon thesabbath day.35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children ofIsrael, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is ofa willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, andsilver, and brass, 35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and finelinen, and goats' hair, 35:7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers'skins, and shittim wood, 35:8 And oil for the light, and spices foranointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 35:9 And onyx stones, andstones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.35:10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all thatthe LORD hath commanded; 35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and hiscovering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and hissockets, 35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,and the vail of the covering, 35:13 The table, and his staves, and allhis vessels, and the shewbread, 35:14 The candlestick also for thelight, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering inof the tabernacle, 35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasengrate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 35:17The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and thehanging for the door of the court, 35:18 The pins of the tabernacle,and the pins of the court, and their cords, 35:19 The cloths ofservice, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaronthe priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest'soffice.35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed fromthe presence of Moses.35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offeringto the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all hisservice, and for the holy garments.35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willinghearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering ofgold unto the LORD.35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, andscarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, andbadgers' skins, brought them.35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass broughtthe LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim woodfor any work of the service, brought it.35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with theirhands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and ofpurple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spungoats' hair.35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, forthe ephod, and for the breastplate; 35:28 And spice, and oil for thelight, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.35:29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for allmanner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand ofMoses.35:30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hathcalled by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribeof Judah; 35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, inwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner ofworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, andin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to setthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, andAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner ofwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of theembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those thatdevise cunning work.36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, inwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work allmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all thatthe LORD had commanded.36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise heartedman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whoseheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And theyreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel hadbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make itwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,came every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake untoMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the serviceof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimedthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any morework for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrainedfrom bringing.36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to makeit, and too much.36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work ofthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, andpurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and thebreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the otherfive curtains he coupled one unto another.36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from theselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side ofanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he inthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: theloops held one curtain to another.36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains oneunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over thetabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits wasthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains bythemselves.36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtainin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtainwhich coupleth the second.36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,that it might be one.36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, anda covering of badgers' skins above that.36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standingup.36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a boardone cubit and a half.36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thusdid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for thesouth side southward: 36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made underthe twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, andtwo sockets under another board for his two tenons.36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward thenorth corner, he made twenty boards, 36:26 And their forty sockets ofsilver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under anotherboard.36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in thetwo sides.36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the headthereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteensockets of silver, under every board two sockets.36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the oneside of the tabernacle, 36:32 And five bars for the boards of theother side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of thetabernacle for the sides westward.36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from theone end to the other.36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings ofgold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and finetwined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaidthem with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them foursockets of silver.36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, andpurple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 36:38 Andthe five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid theirchapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were ofbrass.37:1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a halfwas the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and acubit and a half the height of it: 37:2 And he overlaid it with puregold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the fourcorners of it;

37:8 One cherub on the endon this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out ofthe mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and coveredwith their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.37:10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the lengththereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half theheight thereof: 37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and madethereunto a crown of gold round about.37:12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.37:13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings uponthe four corners that were in the four feet thereof.37:14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for thestaves to bear the table.37:15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withgold, to bear the table.37:16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of puregold.37:17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made hethe candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, andhis flowers, were of the same: 37:18 And six branches going out of thesides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one sidethereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other sidethereof: 37:19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in onebranch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds inanother branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branchesgoing out of the candlestick.37:20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, hisknops, and his flowers: 37:21 And a knop under two branches of thesame, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under twobranches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.37:22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it wasone beaten work of pure gold.37:23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and hissnuffdishes, of pure gold.37:24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vesselsthereof.37:25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of itwas a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and twocubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and thesides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it acrown of gold round about.37:27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, bythe two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places forthe staves to bear it withal.37:28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withgold.37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense ofsweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: fivecubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; itwas foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; thehorns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and theshovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all thevessels thereof made he of brass.38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under thecompass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,to be places for the staves.38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withbrass.38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,to bear it withal;

and the overlaying of theirchapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filletedwith silver.38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, ofblue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twentycubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits,answerable to the hangings of the court.38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and theirfillets of silver.38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court roundabout, were of brass.38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle oftestimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaronthe priest.38:22 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,made all that the LORD commanded Moses.38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and inpurple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work ofthe holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and ninetalents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of thesanctuary.38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregationwas an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescoreand fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 38:26 A bekahfor every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of thesanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty yearsold and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and fivehundred and fifty men.38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets ofthe sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of thehundred talents, a talent for a socket.38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels hemade hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filletedthem.38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and twothousand and four hundred shekels.38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacleof the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate forit, and all the vessels of the altar, 38:31 And the sockets of thecourt round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pinsof the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths ofservice, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garmentsfor Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, andfine twined linen.39:3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it intowires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet,and in the fine linen, with cunning work.39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by thetwo edges was it coupled together.39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of thesame, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, andscarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they shouldbe stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORDcommanded Moses.39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of theephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span wasthe length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was asardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they wereinclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children ofIsrael, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of asignet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, ofwreathen work of pure gold.39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and putthe two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings onthe ends of the breastplate.39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in thetwo ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, beforeit.39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends ofthe breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of theephod inward.39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the twosides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over againstthe other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings ofthe ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curiousgirdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed fromthe ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole ofan habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should notrend.39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between thepomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between thepomegranates; 39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and apomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as theLORD commanded Moses.39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, andfor his sons, 39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets offine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 39:29 And agirdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, ofneedlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, andwrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESSTO THE LORD.39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high uponthe mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of thecongregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to allthat the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and allhis furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, andhis sockets, 39:34 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and thecovering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 39:35 Theark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,39:36 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 39:37The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps tobe set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,39:38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweetincense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 39:39 The brasenaltar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, thelaver and his foot, 39:40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, andhis sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and hispins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for thetent of the congregation, 39:41 The cloths of service to do service inthe holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and hissons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the childrenof Israel made all the work.39:43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had doneit as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Mosesblessed them.40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2 On the first day ofthe first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of thecongregation.40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and coverthe ark with the vail.40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the thingsthat are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in thecandlestick, and light the lamps thereof.40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before theark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to thetabernacle.40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before thedoor of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregationand the altar, and shalt put water therein.40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up thehanging at the court gate.40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vesselsthereof: and it shall be holy.40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and allhis vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar mostholy.40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, thatthey may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointingshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout theirgenerations.40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, sodid he.40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, onthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and rearedup his pillars.40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put thecovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set thestaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of thecovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commandedMoses.40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon theside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as theLORD had commanded Moses.40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, overagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commandedMoses.40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregationbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORDcommanded Moses.40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of thetabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it theburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation andthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and theirfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORDcommanded Moses.40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and thealtar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished thework.40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the gloryof the LORD filled the tabernacle.40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of thecongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of theLORD filled the tabernacle.40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, thechildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if thecloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that itwas taken up.40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, andfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,throughout all their journeys.The Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of thetabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children ofIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering untothe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of theherd, and of the flock.1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer amale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will atthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; andit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood roundabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation.1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron'ssons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon thewood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwardsand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all onthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or ofthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male withoutblemish.1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward beforethe LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his bloodround about upon the altar.1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the firewhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and thelegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it uponthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be offowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of youngpigeons.1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off hishead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrungout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his cropwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, bythe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wingsthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn itupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burntsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, hisoffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, andput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sonsthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flourthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And theremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is athing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in theoven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, orunleavened wafers anointed with oil.2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall beof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meatoffering.2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, itshall be made of fine flour with oil.2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of thesethings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, heshall bring it unto the altar.2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorialthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made byfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's andhis sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD madeby fire.2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall bemade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in anyoffering of the LORD made by fire.2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them untothe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season withsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God tobe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shaltoffer salt.2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto theLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits greenears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: itis a meat offering.2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beatencorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincensethereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offerit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer itwithout blemish before the LORD.3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and killit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sonsthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering anoffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth theinwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:4 And the twokidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and thecaul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.3:5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burntsacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.3:6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto theLORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it withoutblemish.3:7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it beforethe LORD.3:8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and killit before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shallsprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.3:9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering anoffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the wholerump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat thatcovereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:10And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by theflanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall hetake away.3:11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire unto the LORD.3:12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before theLORD.3:13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it beforethe tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shallsprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.3:14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made byfire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fatthat is upon the inwards, 3:15 And the two kidneys, and the fat thatis upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,with the kidneys, it shall he take away.3:16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is theLORD's.3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughoutall your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the childrenof Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against anyof the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not tobe done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that isanointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bringfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemishunto the LORD for a sin offering.4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon thebullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priestshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seventimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of thealtar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle ofthe congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at thebottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for thesin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat thatis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is uponthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with thekidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from thebullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burnthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the wholebullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have donesomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning thingswhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, whichthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shalloffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacleof the congregation.4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon thehead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killedbefore the LORD.4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock'sblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shalldip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven timesbefore the LORD, even before the vail.4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altarwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of thecongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of thealtar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation.4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon thealtar.4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for asin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make anatonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burnhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for thecongregation.4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignoranceagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning thingswhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, whereinhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, akid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay hishand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where theykill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering withhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burntoffering.4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of thesacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonementfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, whilehe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORDconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 4:28 Orif his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shallbring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, forhis sin which he hath sinned.4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, andslay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shallpour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is takenaway from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shallburn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and thepriest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.4:32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it afemale without blemish.4:33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, andslay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burntoffering.4:34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering withhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:4:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of thelamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and thepriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings madeby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for hissin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is awitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,then he shall bear his iniquity.5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase ofan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase ofunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shallbe unclean, and guilty.5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness itbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when heknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to dogood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and itbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in oneof these.5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And heshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which hehath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for himconcerning his sin.5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for histrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for aburnt offering.5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer thatwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from hisneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle ofthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the restof the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is asin offering.5:10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according tothe manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sinwhich he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.5:11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenthpart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oilupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is asin offering.5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall takehis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sinoffering.5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching hissin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit atrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram withoutblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in theholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto thepriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram ofthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which areforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wistit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, withthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and thepriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorancewherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed againstthe LORD.6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, andcommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in thatwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing takenaway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have foundthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; inany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shallbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore thatwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfullygotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thingwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; heshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth partmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the dayof his trespass offering.6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ramwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespassoffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonementfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing ofall that he hath done in trespassing therein.6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and hissons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burntoffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto themorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linenbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which thefire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shallput them beside the altar.6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, andcarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall notbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, andlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon thefat of the peace offerings.6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never goout.6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shalloffer it before the LORD, before the altar.6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meatoffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which isupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweetsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: withunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court ofthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them fortheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is thesin offering, and as the trespass offering.6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. Itshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning theofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shallbe holy.6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offeringof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in theday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour fora meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereofat night.6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thoushalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shaltthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shalloffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be whollyburnt.6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: itshall not be eaten.6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron andto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the placewhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killedbefore the LORD: it is most holy.6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holyplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of thecongregation.6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and whenthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shaltwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: andif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsedin water.6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is mostholy.6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into thetabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is mostholy.7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they killthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle roundabout upon the altar.7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and thefat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fatthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is abovethe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priestshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto theLORD: it is a trespass offering.7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eatenin the holy place: it is most holy.7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is onelaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall haveit.7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even thepriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which hehath offered.7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all thatis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest'sthat offereth it.7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all thesons of Aaron have, one as much as another.7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which heshall offer unto the LORD.7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with thesacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, andunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, offine flour, fried.7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened breadwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for anheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's thatsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings forthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shallnot leave any of it until the morning.7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntaryoffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth hissacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third dayshall be burnt with fire.7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offeringsbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neithershall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be anabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be cleanshall eat thereof.7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peaceofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness uponhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as theuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable uncleanthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, whichpertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from hispeople.7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, orof sheep, or of goat.7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat ofthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but yeshall in no wise eat of it.7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer anoffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth itshall be cut off from his people.7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowlor of beast, in any of your dwellings.7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even thatsoul shall be cut off from his people.7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of hispeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORDof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may bewaved for a wave offering before the LORD.7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breastshall be Aaron's and his sons'.7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heaveoffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peaceofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of thechildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by astatute for ever from among the children of Israel.7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of theanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in thepriest's office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of thechildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute forever throughout their generations.7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, andof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of theconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Whichthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commandedthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in thewilderness of Sinai.8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sonswith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock forthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly wasgathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which theLORD commanded to be done.8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, andclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girdedhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto himtherewith.8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in thebreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even uponhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as theLORD commanded Moses.8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle andall that was therein, and sanctified them.8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointedthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, tosanctify them.8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, andanointed him, to sanctify him.8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, andgirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORDcommanded Moses.8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron andhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sinoffering.8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon thehorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified thealtar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctifiedit, to make reconciliation upon it.8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caulabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burnedit upon the altar.8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burntwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and hissons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altarround about.8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and thepieces, and the fat.8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burntthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweetsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORDcommanded Moses.8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaronand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put itupon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his righthand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon thetip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, andupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the bloodupon the altar round about.8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was uponthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, andtheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket ofunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavenedcake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on thefat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron'shands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offeringbefore the LORD.8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on thealtar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweetsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offeringbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; asthe LORD commanded Moses.8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which wasupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; andsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'garments with him.8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with thebread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,Aaron and his sons shall eat it.8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall yeburn with fire.8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be atan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, tomake an atonement for you.8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of theLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded bythe hand of Moses.9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron andhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Takethee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take yea kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both ofthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also abullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appearunto you.9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacleof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stoodbefore the LORD.9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that yeshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sinoffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make anatonement for them; as the LORD commanded.9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sinoffering, which was for himself.9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dippedhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, andpoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, andthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, heburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented untohim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the piecesthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon theburnt offering on the altar.9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, whichwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it forsin, as the first.9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according tothe manner.9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of themorning.9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peaceofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented untohim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 Andthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that whichcovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat uponthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved fora wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burntoffering, and peace offerings.9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORDappeared unto all the people.9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed uponthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the peoplesaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them hiscenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offeredstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, andthey died before the LORD.10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before allthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel theuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethrenfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of thecamp; as Moses had said.10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, hissons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, thewhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is uponyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine norstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into thetabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put differencebetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And thatye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORDhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of theofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven besidethe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holyplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices ofthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a cleanplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they bethy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices ofpeace offerings of the children of Israel.10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with theofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offeringbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by astatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, thesons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have yenot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, tomake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood ofit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed haveeaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offeredtheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and suchthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And whenMoses heard that, he was content.11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beastswhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth thecud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, orof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth thecud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not thehoof; he is unclean unto you.11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not thehoof; he is unclean unto you.11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye nottouch; they are unclean to you.11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hathfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, themshall ye eat.11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in therivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing whichis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 Theyshall be even an abomination unto you;

11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after hiskind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after hiskind, and the grasshopper after his kind.11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,shall be an abomination unto you.11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth thecarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall washhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is notclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every onethat toucheth them shall be unclean.11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beaststhat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth theircarcase shall be unclean until the even.11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping thingsthat creep upon the earth;

for they are anabomination.11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thingthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,that ye should be defiled thereby.11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctifyyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall yedefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth uponthe earth.11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of everyliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature thatcreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between theunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and thebeast that may not be eaten.12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born aman child: then she shall be unclean seven days;

she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into thesanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean twoweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood ofher purifying threescore and six days.12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, orfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burntoffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement forher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This isthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring twoturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and theother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement forher, and she shall be clean.13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a manshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then heshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons thepriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin ofthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and theplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plagueof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce himunclean.13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and insight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turnedwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague sevendays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spreadnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not inthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: andhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that hehath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen ofthe priest again.13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in theskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be broughtunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, ifthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosyin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosycover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even tohis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shallconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, heshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turnedwhite: he is clean.13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to beunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, heshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shallpronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,and is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a whiterising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it beshewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turnedwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague ofleprosy broken out of the boil.13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no whitehairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhatdark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if itspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce himunclean: it is a plague.13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it isa burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hotburning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,somewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it bein sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of theburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is theplague of leprosy.13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no whitehair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, butbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it bespread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce himunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in theskin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and thepriest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of theburning.13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be insight deeper than the skin;

then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague ofthe scall seven days: 13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shalllook on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there bein it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than theskin; 13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; andthe priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeperthan the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shallwash his clothes, and be clean.13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall bespread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he isunclean.13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there isblack hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and thepriest shall pronounce him clean.13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh brightspots, even white bright spots;

yetis he clean.13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his headtoward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a whitereddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his baldforehead.13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the risingof the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his baldforehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 13:44 Heis a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce himutterly unclean; his plague is in his head.13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, andshall cry, Unclean, unclean.13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall bedefiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shallhis habitation be.13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it bea woollen garment, or a linen garment; 13:48 Whether it be in thewarp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin; 13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish inthe garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or inany thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed untothe priest: 13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shutup it that hath the plague seven days: 13:51 And he shall look on theplague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment,either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work thatis made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, inwoollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: forit is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be notspread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; 13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash thething wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it iswashed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, andthe plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in thefire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat darkafter the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, orout of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 13:57 And ifit appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, orin any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn thatwherein the plague is with fire.13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing ofskin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed fromthem, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollenor linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, topronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 This shall be the lawof the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto thepriest: 14:3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp;

andafterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 14:20 And the priest shalloffer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and thepriest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean.14:21 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall takeone lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement forhim, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meatoffering, and a log of oil; 14:22 And two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sinoffering, and the other a burnt offering.14:23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing untothe priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,before the LORD.14:24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, andthe log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offeringbefore the LORD: 14:25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespassoffering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespassoffering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is tobe cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the greattoe of his right foot: 14:26 And the priest shall pour of the oil intothe palm of his own left hand: 14:27 And the priest shall sprinklewith his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seventimes before the LORD: 14:28 And the priest shall put of the oil thatis in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to becleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toeof his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespassoffering: 14:29 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's handhe shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make anatonement for him before the LORD.14:30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the youngpigeons, such as he can get;

15:33 And of her that issick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and ofthe woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.16:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons ofAaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; 16:2 And the LORDsaid unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at alltimes into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, whichis upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud uponthe mercy seat.16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullockfor a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linenbreeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, andwith the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.16:5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israeltwo kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burntoffering.16:6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which isfor himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORDat the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for theLORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,and offer him for a sin offering.16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shallbe presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, andto let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.16:11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which isfor himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for hishouse, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is forhimself: 16:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals offire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweetincense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 16:13 And he shallput the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of theincense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that hedie not: 16:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, andsprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and beforethe mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seventimes.16:15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for thepeople, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood ashe did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercyseat, and before the mercy seat: 16:16 And he shall make an atonementfor the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children ofIsrael, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and soshall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remainethamong them in the midst of their uncleanness.16:17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregationwhen he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he comeout, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household,and for all the congregation of Israel.16:18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, andmake an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altarround about.16:19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seventimes, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of thechildren of Israel.16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, andthe tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring thelive goat: 16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head ofthe live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the childrenof Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, puttingthem upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand ofa fit man into the wilderness: 16:22 And the goat shall bear upon himall their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let gothe goat in the wilderness.16:23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he wentinto the holy place, and shall leave them there: 16:24 And he shallwash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments,and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offeringof the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people.16:25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash hisclothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into thecamp.16:27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sinoffering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holyplace, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn inthe fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.16:28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe hisflesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.16:29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in theseventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict yoursouls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country,or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 16:30 For on that day shallthe priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may beclean from all your sins before the LORD.16:31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflictyour souls, by a statute for ever.16:32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shallconsecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead,shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even theholy garments: 16:33 And he shall make an atonement for the holysanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of thecongregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement forthe priests, and for all the people of the congregation.16:34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make anatonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto Aaron, andunto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them;This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying, 17:3 What mansoever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb,or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 17:4 Andbringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD;blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that manshall be cut off from among his people: 17:5 To the end that thechildren of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in theopen field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the doorof the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer themfor peace offerings unto the LORD.17:6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of theLORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn thefat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.17:7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, afterwhom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever untothem throughout their generations.17:8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of thehouse of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, thatoffereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 17:9 And bringeth it not untothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto theLORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.17:10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of thestrangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; Iwill even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and willcut him off from among his people.17:11 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given itto you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it isthe blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.17:12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of youshall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among youeat blood.17:13 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of thestrangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beastor fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof,and cover it with dust.17:14 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the lifethereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eatthe blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is theblood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.17:15 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or thatwhich was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, ora stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself inwater, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.17:16 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bearhis iniquity.18:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God.18:3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall yenot do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bringyou, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.18:4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walktherein: I am the LORD your God.18:5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if aman do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.18:6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, touncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.18:7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover hernakedness.18:8 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it isthy father's nakedness.18:9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, ordaughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad,even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.18:10 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter'sdaughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs isthine own nakedness.18:11 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thyfather, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.18:12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: sheis thy father's near kinswoman.18:13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: forshe is thy mother's near kinswoman.18:14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.18:15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: sheis thy son's wife;

for they are her nearkinswomen: it is wickedness.18:18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, touncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.18:19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover hernakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.18:20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife,to defile thyself with her.18:21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire toMolech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it isabomination.18:23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyselftherewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie downthereto: it is confusion.18:24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in allthese the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 18:25 Andthe land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof uponit, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants.18:26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shallnot commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation,nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 18:27 (For all theseabominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, andthe land is defiled;) 18:28 That the land spue not you out also, whenye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you.18:29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even thesouls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.18:30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not anyone of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, andthat ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God.19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 19:2 Speak unto all thecongregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall beholy: for I the LORD your God am holy.19:3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep mysabbaths: I am the LORD your God.19:4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I amthe LORD your God.19:5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, yeshall offer it at your own will.19:6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in thefire.19:7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; itshall not be accepted.19:8 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soulshall be cut off from among his people.19:9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not whollyreap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaningsof thy harvest.19:10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gatherevery grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor andstranger: I am the LORD your God.19:11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one toanother.19:12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thouprofane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.19:13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wagesof him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until themorning.19:14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock beforethe blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.19:15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt notrespect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty:but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people:neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am theLORD.19:17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt inany wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the childrenof thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am theLORD.19:19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle genderwith a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed:neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.19:20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom givenher; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, becauseshe was not free.19:21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespassoffering.19:22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram ofthe trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done:and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him.19:23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted allmanner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof asuncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: itshall not be eaten of.19:24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy topraise the LORD withal.19:25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that itmay yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.19:26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye useenchantment, nor observe times.19:27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thoumar the corners of thy beard.19:28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, norprint any marks upon you: I am the LORD.19:29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lestthe land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.19:30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am theLORD.19:31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek afterwizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.19:32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face ofthe old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.19:33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall notvex him.19:34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as oneborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye werestrangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.19:35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, inweight, or in measure.19:36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shallye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land ofEgypt.19:37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all myjudgments, and do them: I am the LORD.20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:2 Again, thou shalt sayto the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel,or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of hisseed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of theland shall stone him with stones.20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him offfrom among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech,to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes fromthe man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commitwhoredom with Molech, from among their people.20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my faceagainst that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORDyour God.20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD whichsanctify you.20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall besurely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; hisblood shall be upon him.20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, theadulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.20:11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered hisfather's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; theirblood shall be upon them.20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shallsurely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shallbe upon them.20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, bothof them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put todeath; their blood shall be upon them.20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: theyshall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be nowickedness among you.20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:and ye shall slay the beast.20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put todeath; their blood shall be upon them.20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, orhis mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see hisnakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in thesight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; heshall bear his iniquity.20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, andshall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and shehath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall becut off from among their people.20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister,nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shallbear their iniquity.20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncoveredhis uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall diechildless.20:21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an uncleanthing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall bechildless.20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spueyou not out.20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I castout before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore Iabhorred them.20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and Iwill give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk andhoney: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from otherpeople.20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts andunclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not makeyour souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of livingthing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you asunclean.20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and havesevered you from other people, that ye should be mine.20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is awizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them withstones: their blood shall be upon them.21:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons ofAaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the deadamong his people: 21:2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, thatis, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for hisdaughter, and for his brother.21:3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hathhad no husband; for her may he be defiled.21:4 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among hispeople, to profane himself.21:5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall theyshave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in theirflesh.21:6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name oftheir God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the breadof their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.21:7 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neithershall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy untohis God.21:8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread ofthy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctifyyou, am holy.21:9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playingthe whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.21:10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whosehead the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put onthe garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 21:11Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for hisfather, or for his mother; 21:12 Neither shall he go out of thesanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of theanointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD.21:13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.21:14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, theseshall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people towife.21:15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I theLORD do sanctify him.21:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 21:17 Speak unto Aaron,saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath anyblemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.21:18 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall notapproach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous, 21:19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, orbrokenhanded, 21:20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemishin his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 21:21No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall comenigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath ablemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God.21:22 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and ofthe holy.21:23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto thealtar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries:for I the LORD do sanctify them.21:24 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all thechildren of Israel.22:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:2 Speak unto Aaron andto his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of thechildren of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in thosethings which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD.22:3 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among yourgenerations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children ofIsrael hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, thatsoul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.22:4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath arunning issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a manwhose seed goeth from him; 22:5 Or whosoever toucheth any creepingthing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may takeuncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 22:6 The soul which hathtouched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of theholy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.22:7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterwardeat of the holy things; because it is his food.22:8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall noteat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.22:9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin forit, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctifythem.22:10 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner ofthe priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.22:11 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat ofit, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.22:12 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, shemay not eat of an offering of the holy things.22:13 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and haveno child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth,she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eatthereof.22:14 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shallput the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priestwith the holy thing.22:15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children ofIsrael, which they offer unto the LORD; 22:16 Or suffer them to bearthe iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I theLORD do sanctify them.22:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:18 Speak unto Aaron,and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say untothem, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers inIsrael, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all hisfreewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burntoffering; 22:19 Ye shall offer at your own will a male withoutblemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.22:20 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for itshall not be acceptable for you.22:21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto theLORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep,it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.22:22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, orscabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offeringby fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.22:23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous orlacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering;but for a vow it shall not be accepted.22:24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, orcrushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereofin your land.22:25 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of yourGod of any of these; because their corruption is in them, andblemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.22:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22:27 When a bullock, ora sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven daysunder the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall beaccepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.22:28 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and heryoung both in one day.22:29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto theLORD, offer it at your own will.22:30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of ituntil the morrow: I am the LORD.22:31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am theLORD.22:32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowedamong the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 22:33That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am theLORD.23:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of theLORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these aremy feasts.23:3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbathof rest, an holy convocation;

sevensabbaths shall be complete: 23:16 Even unto the morrow after theseventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a newmeat offering unto the LORD.23:17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of twotenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken withleaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.23:18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish ofthe first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be fora burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and theirdrink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour untothe LORD.23:19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering,and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.23:20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruitsfor a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall beholy to the LORD for the priest.23:21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be anholy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: itshall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout yourgenerations.23:22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not makeclean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neithershalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave themunto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.23:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:24 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day ofthe month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets,an holy convocation.23:25 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer anoffering made by fire unto the LORD.23:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:27 Also on the tenthday of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shallbe an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, andoffer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.23:28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day ofatonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God.23:29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in thatsame day, he shall be cut off from among his people.23:30 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day,the same soul will I destroy from among his people.23:31 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for everthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.23:32 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflictyour souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even untoeven, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.23:33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23:34 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh monthshall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.23:35 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do noservile work therein.23:36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto theLORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;

all that are Israelitesborn shall dwell in booths: 23:43 That your generations may know thatI made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought themout of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.23:44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of theLORD.24:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:2 Command the childrenof Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for thelight, to cause the lamps to burn continually.24:3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of thecongregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morningbefore the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in yourgenerations.24:4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before theLORD continually.24:5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:two tenth deals shall be in one cake.24:6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the puretable before the LORD.24:7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it maybe on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto theLORD.24:8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORDcontinually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlastingcovenant.24:9 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it inthe holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of theLORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.24:10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was anEgyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of theIsraelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;24:11 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord,and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's namewas Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 24:12 Andthey put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them.24:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24:14 Bring forth himthat hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him laytheir hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.24:15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.24:16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely beput to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: aswell the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeththe name of the Lord, shall be put to death.24:17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.24:18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.24:19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done,so shall it be done to him; 24:20 Breach for breach, eye for eye,tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it bedone to him again.24:21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he thatkilleth a man, he shall be put to death.24:22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, asfor one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.24:23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they shouldbring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him withstones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 25:2 Speakunto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into theland which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto theLORD.25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shaltprune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 25:4 But in theseventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath forthe LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shaltnot reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is ayear of rest unto the land.25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, andfor thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and forthy stranger that sojourneth with thee.25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shallall the increase thereof be meat.25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seventimes seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shallbe unto thee forty and nine years.25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on thetenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye makethe trumpet sound throughout all your land.25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim libertythroughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall bea jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession,and ye shall return every man unto his family.25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow,neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapesin it of thy vine undressed.25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eatthe increase thereof out of the field.25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto hispossession.25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought ofthy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 25:15According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy ofthy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits heshall sell unto thee: 25:16 According to the multitude of years thoushalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness ofyears thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the numberof the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fearthy God:for I am the LORD your God.25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and dothem; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,and dwell therein in safety.25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold,we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 25:21 Then I willcommand my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bringforth fruit for three years.25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit untilthe ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the oldstore.25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, forye are strangers and sojourners with me.25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant aredemption for the land.25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of hispossession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall heredeem that which his brother sold.25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able toredeem it; 25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, andrestore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he mayreturn unto his possession.25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which issold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until theyear of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall returnunto his possession.25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he mayredeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year mayhe redeem it.25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, thenthe house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever tohim that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out inthe jubile.25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round aboutthem shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may beredeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of thecities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that wassold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year ofjubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are theirpossession among the children of Israel.25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;for it is their perpetual possession.25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or asojourner; that he may live with thee.25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; thatthy brother may live with thee.25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thyvictuals for increase.25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the landof Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and besold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be withthee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his childrenwith him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto thepossession of his fathers shall he return.25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the landof Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thyGod.25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buybondmen and bondmaids.25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn amongyou, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children afteryou, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen forever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not ruleone over another with rigour.25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brotherthat dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger orsojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 25:48After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethrenmay redeem him: 25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeemhim, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him;or if he be able, he may redeem himself.25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year thathe was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his saleshall be according unto the number of years, according to the time ofan hired servant shall it be with him.25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shallgive again the price of his redemption out of the money that he wasbought for.25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, thenhe shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he givehim again the price of his redemption.25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and theother shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go outin the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are myservants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORDyour God.26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you upa standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in yourland, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am theLORD.26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yieldher increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintageshall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to thefull, and dwell in your land safely.26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, andnone shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of theland, neither shall the sword go through your land.26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before youby the sword.26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of youshall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall beforeyou by the sword.26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, andmultiply you, and establish my covenant with you.26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because ofthe new.26:11 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhoryou.26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall bemy people.26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the landof Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken thebands of your yoke, and made you go upright.26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all thesecommandments; 26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if yoursoul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments,but that ye break my covenant: 26:16 I also will do this unto you; Iwill even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague,that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shallsow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain beforeyour enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shallflee when none pursueth you.26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I willpunish you seven times more for your sins.26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make yourheaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 26:20 And your strength shallbe spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neithershall the trees of the land yield their fruits.26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; Iwill bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you ofyour children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number;and your high ways shall be desolate.26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but willwalk contrary unto me; 26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you,and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrelof my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities,I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered intothe hand of the enemy.26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shallbake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your breadagain by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walkcontrary unto me; 26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also infury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of yourdaughters shall ye eat.26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soulshall abhor you.26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuariesunto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemieswhich dwell therein shall be astonished at it.26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out asword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your citieswaste.26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it liethdesolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the landrest, and enjoy her sabbaths.26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did notrest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintnessinto their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of ashaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from asword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword,when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before yourenemies.26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of yourenemies shall eat you up.26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquityin your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathersshall they pine away with them.26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of theirfathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, andthat also they have walked contrary unto me; 26:41 And that I alsohave walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land oftheir enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and theythen accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 26:42 Then will Iremember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, andalso my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember theland.26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy hersabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall acceptof the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because theydespised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies,I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy themutterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD theirGod.26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of theirancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sightof the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORDmade between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the handof Moses.27:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make asingular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.27:3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years oldeven unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekelsof silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.27:4 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirtyshekels.27:5 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, thenthy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the femaleten shekels.27:6 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thyestimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for thefemale thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.27:7 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female tenshekels.27:8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall presenthimself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; accordingto his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.27:9 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto theLORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.27:10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a badfor a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it andthe exchange thereof shall be holy.27:11 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer asacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before thepriest: 27:12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good orbad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.27:13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth partthereof unto thy estimation.27:14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto theLORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: asthe priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.27:15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then heshall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, andit shall be his.27:16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a fieldof his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seedthereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels ofsilver.27:17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according tothy estimation it shall stand.27:18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priestshall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain,even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thyestimation.27:19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it,then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation untoit, and it shall be assured to him.27:20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold thefield to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.27:21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holyunto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be thepriest's.27:22 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hathbought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 27:23 Then thepriest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even untothe year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in thatday, as a holy thing unto the LORD.27:24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him ofwhom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land didbelong.27:25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of thesanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.27:26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'sfirstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it isthe LORD's.27:27 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem itaccording to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of itthereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according tothy estimation.27:28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote untothe LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the fieldof his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing ismost holy unto the LORD.27:29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed;but shall surely be put to death.27:30 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land,or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD.27:31 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shalladd thereto the fifth part thereof.27:32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even ofwhatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto theLORD.27:33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall hechange it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the changethereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.27:34 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses forthe children of Israel in mount Sinai.The Fourth Book of Moses:  Called Numbers1:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in thetabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month,in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,saying, 1:2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children ofIsrael, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with thenumber of their names, every male by their polls; 1:3 From twentyyears old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel:thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.1:4 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one headof the house of his fathers.1:5 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: ofthe tribe of Reuben;

and the cattle of theLevites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the childrenof Israel.3:42 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstbornamong the children of Israel.3:43 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a monthold and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty andtwo thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen.3:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 3:45 Take the Levitesinstead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and thecattle of the Levites instead of their cattle;

a thousand three hundred andthreescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 3:51And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and tohis sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commandedMoses.4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 4:2 Take thesum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after theirfamilies, by the house of their fathers, 4:3 From thirty years old andupward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to dothe work in the tabernacle of the congregation.4:4 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacleof the congregation, about the most holy things: 4:5 And when the campsetteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall takedown the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 4:6And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spreadover it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.4:7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and coversto cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 4:8 Andthey shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the samewith a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the stavesthereof.4:9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick ofthe light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and allthe oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 4:10 Andthey shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering ofbadgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.4:11 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, andcover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to thestaves thereof: 4:12 And they shall take all the instruments ofministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in acloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, andshall put them on a bar: 4:13 And they shall take away the ashes fromthe altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 4:14 And they shall putupon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it,even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, allthe vessels of the altar;

that theydefile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell.5:4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without thecamp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.5:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:6 Speak unto the childrenof Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit,to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 5:7 Thenthey shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shallrecompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto itthe fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hathtrespassed.5:8 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto,let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest;beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be madefor him.5:9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children ofIsrael, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.5:10 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any mangiveth the priest, it shall be his.5:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:12 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, andcommit a trespass against him, 5:13 And a man lie with her carnally,and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and shebe defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be takenwith the manner; 5:14 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and hebe jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit ofjealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be notdefiled: 5:15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, andhe shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah ofbarley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincensethereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial,bringing iniquity to remembrance.5:16 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:5:17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and ofthe dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take,and put it into the water: 5:18 And the priest shall set the womanbefore the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering ofmemorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priestshall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:19And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, Ifno man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside touncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free fromthis bitter water that causeth the curse: 5:20 But if thou hast goneaside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, andsome man have lain with thee beside thine husband: 5:21 Then thepriest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priestshall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath amongthy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly toswell; 5:22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thybowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And thewoman shall say, Amen, amen.5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shallblot them out with the bitter water: 5:24 And he shall cause the womanto drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water thatcauseth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.5:25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of thewoman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offerit upon the altar: 5:26 And the priest shall take an handful of theoffering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, andafterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.5:27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall cometo pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against herhusband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her,and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot:and the woman shall be a curse among her people.5:28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall befree, and shall conceive seed.5:29 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to anotherinstead of her husband, and is defiled; 5:30 Or when the spirit ofjealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shallset the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon herall this law.5:31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this womanshall bear her iniquity.6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 Speak unto the childrenof Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separatethemselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto theLORD: 6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, andshall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neithershall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.6:4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is madeof the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.6:5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razorcome upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which heseparateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let thelocks of the hair of his head grow.6:6 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shallcome at no dead body.6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for hismother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because theconsecration of his God is upon his head.6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.6:9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled thehead of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day ofhis cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.6:10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two youngpigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation: 6:11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sinoffering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonementfor him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his headthat same day.6:12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation,and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: butthe days that were before shall be lost, because his separation wasdefiled.6:13 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of hisseparation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation: 6:14 And he shall offer his offeringunto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for aburnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish fora sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 6:15And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled withoil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meatoffering, and their drink offerings.6:16 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offerhis sin offering, and his burnt offering: 6:17 And he shall offer theram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basketof unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering,and his drink offering.6:18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair ofthe head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under thesacrifice of the peace offerings.6:19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and oneunleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shallput them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of hisseparation is shaven: 6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a waveoffering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wavebreast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.6:21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of hisoffering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his handshall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do afterthe law of his separation.6:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:23 Speak unto Aaron andunto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children ofIsrael, saying unto them, 6:24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:6:25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious untothee: 6:26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give theepeace.6:27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and Iwill bless them.7:1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up thetabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all theinstruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, andhad anointed them, and sanctified them; 7:2 That the princes ofIsrael, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes ofthe tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: 7:3 Andthey brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, andtwelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox:and they brought them before the tabernacle.7:4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:5 Take it of them, thatthey may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation;and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according tohis service.7:6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto theLevites.7:7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,according to their service: 7:8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gaveunto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the handof Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.7:9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service ofthe sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon theirshoulders.7:10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the daythat it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering beforethe altar.7:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.7:12 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon theson of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah: 7:13 And his offering was onesilver charger, the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels,one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary;both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meatoffering: 7:14 One spoon of ten shekels of gold, full of incense: 7:15One young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burntoffering: 7:16 One kid of the goats for a sin offering: 7:17 And for asacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, fivelambs of the first year: this was the offering of Nahshon the son ofAmminadab.7:18 On the second day Nethaneel the son of Zuar, prince of Issachar,did offer: 7:19 He offered for his offering one silver charger, theweight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl ofseventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary;

Thus shaltthou do unto the Levites touching their charge.9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in thefirst month of the second year after they were come out of the land ofEgypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passoverat his appointed season.9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it inhis appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and accordingto all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keepthe passover.9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the firstmonth at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that theLORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of aman, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they camebefore Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said untohim, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we keptback, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointedseason among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerningyou.9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterityshall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afaroff, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keepit, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any boneof it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keepit.9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, andforbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut offfrom among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORDin his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep thepassover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover,and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have oneordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in theland.9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloudcovered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at eventhere was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, untilthe morning.9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearanceof fire by night.9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then afterthat the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where thecloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloudabode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyednot.9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, theyjourneyed.9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that thecloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children ofIsrael abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was takenup, they journeyed.9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and atthe commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge ofthe LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee twotrumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thoumayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for thejourneying of the camps.10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shallassemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation.10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, whichare heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves untothee.10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east partsshall go forward.10:6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie onthe south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm fortheir journeys.10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shallblow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout yourgenerations.10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy thatoppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and yeshall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be savedfrom your enemies.10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, andin the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets overyour burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORDyour God.10:11 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, inthe second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacleof the testimony.10:12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of thewilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.10:13 And they first took their journey according to the commandmentof the LORD by the hand of Moses.10:14 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the childrenof Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon theson of Amminadab.10:15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar wasNethaneel the son of Zuar.10:16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun wasEliab the son of Helon.10:17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon andthe sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.10:18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according totheir armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.10:19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon wasShelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.10:20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad wasEliasaph the son of Deuel.10:21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and theother did set up the tabernacle against they came.10:22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim setforward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama theson of Ammihud.10:23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh wasGamaliel the son of Pedahzur.10:24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin wasAbidan the son of Gideoni.10:25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward,which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: andover his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher wasPagiel the son of Ocran.10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali wasAhira the son of Enan.10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according totheir armies, when they set forward.10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which theLORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do theegood: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mineown land, and to my kindred.10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thouknowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be tous instead of eyes.10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that whatgoodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them inthe three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they wentout of the camp.10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them thathate thee flee before thee.10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the manythousands of Israel.11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and theLORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORDburnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost partsof the camp.11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto theLORD, the fire was quenched.11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire ofthe LORD burnt among them.11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: andthe children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give usflesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egyptfreely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothingat all, beside this manna, before our eyes.11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof asthe colour of bdellium.11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it inmills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes ofit: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fellupon it.11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD waskindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thyservant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thoulayest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceivedall this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say untome, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the suckingchild, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weepunto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is tooheavy for me.11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out ofhand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see mywretchedness.11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of theelders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of thecongregation, that they may stand there with thee.11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will takeof the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and theyshall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it notthyself alone.11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of theLORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with usin Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neitherten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it comeout at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that yehave despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, Thepeople, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thouhast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to sufficethem?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'shand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come topass unto thee or not.11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set themround about the tabernacle.11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and tookof the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, theyprophesied, and did not cease.11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of theone was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit restedupon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not outunto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad andMedad do prophesy in the camp.11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of hisyoung men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would Godthat all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would puthis spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he andthe elders of Israel.11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quailsfrom the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day'sjourney on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the otherside, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon theface of the earth.11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, andall the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered leastgathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselvesround about the camp.11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it waschewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and theLORD smote the people with a very great plague.11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: becausethere they buried the people that lusted.11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;and abode at Hazeroth.12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopianwoman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath henot spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which wereupon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly untoMoses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto thetabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood inthe door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they bothcame forth.12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speakunto him in a dream.12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not indark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and hedeparted.12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,and, behold, she was leprous.12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, laynot the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein wehave sinned.12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumedwhen he cometh out of his mother's womb.12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, Ibeseech thee.12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in herface, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out fromthe camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the peoplejourneyed not till Miriam was brought in again.12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched inthe wilderness of Paran.13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, thatthey may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children ofIsrael: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every onea ruler among them.13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from thewilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children ofIsrael.13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua theson of Zaccur.13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddithe son of Susi.13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out theland.And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said untothem, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleththerein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And whatthe land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and whatcities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strongholds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whetherthere be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring ofthe fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripegrapes.13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness ofZin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; whereAhiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebronwas built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came untothe brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with onecluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and theybrought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster ofgrapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all thecongregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all thecongregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thousentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is thefruit of it.13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, andthe cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw thechildren of Anak there.13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and theCanaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us goup at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go upagainst the people; for they are stronger than we.13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they hadsearched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through whichwe have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitantsthereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a greatstature.13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of thegiants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we werein their sight.14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; andthe people wept that night.14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and againstAaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that wehad died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in thiswilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto thisland, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should bea prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And theysaid one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return intoEgypt.14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assemblyof the congregation of the children of Israel.14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, whichwere of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And theyspake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, Theland, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people ofthe land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed fromthem, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And theglory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore all the children of Israel.14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provokeme?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signswhich I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with thepestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greaternation and mightier than they.14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for theyhave heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD artseen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and thatthou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in apillar of fire by night.14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then thenations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land whichhe sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,according as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD islongsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity andtransgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting theiniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourthgeneration.14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people accordingunto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven thispeople, from Egypt even until now.14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the gloryof the LORD.14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me nowthese ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely theyshall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shallany of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shallpossess it.14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of theRed sea.14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 Howlong shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur againstme? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which theymurmur against me.14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye havespoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shallfall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, accordingto your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which havemurmured against me.14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which Isware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, andJoshua the son of Nun.14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them willI bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in thiswilderness.14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in thewilderness.14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, evenforty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, evenforty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evilcongregation, that are gathered together against me: in thiswilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up aslander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evilreport upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, whichwere of the men that went to search the land, lived still.14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:and the people mourned greatly.14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into thetop of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto theplace which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandmentof the LORD? but it shall not prosper.14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smittenbefore your enemies.14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, andye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,therefore the LORD will not be with you.14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless theark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of thecamp.14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt inthat hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the landof your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make anoffering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice inperforming a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring ameat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part ofan hin of oil.15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shaltthou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenthdeals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of anhin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for asacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenthdeals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for alamb, or a kid.15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do toevery one according to their number.15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things afterthis manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savourunto the LORD.15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you inyour generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweetsavour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, andalso for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for everin your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before theLORD.15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the strangerthat sojourneth with you.15:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:18 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the landwhither I bring you, 15:19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of thebread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heaveoffering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shallye heave it.15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heaveoffering in your generations.15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORDhath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORDcommanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Thenit shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledgeof the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one youngbullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, withhis meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregationof the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it isignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made byfire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for theirignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of thechildren of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;seeing all the people were in ignorance.15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a shegoat of the first year for a sin offering.15:28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinnethignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make anatonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for thestranger that sojourneth among them.15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be bornin the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and thatsoul shall be cut off from among his people.15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath brokenhis commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquityshall be upon him.15:32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, theyfound a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.15:33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Mosesand Aaron, and unto all the congregation.15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared whatshould be done to him.15:35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put todeath: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without thecamp.15:36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, andstoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in theborders of their garments throughout their generations, and that theyput upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And itshall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and rememberall the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek notafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go awhoring: 15:40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, andbe holy unto your God.15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land ofEgypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.16:1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth,sons of Reuben, took men: 16:2 And they rose up before Moses, withcertain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes ofthe assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 16:3 And theygathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and saidunto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation areholy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore thenlift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?  16:4 Andwhen Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 16:5 And he spake untoKorah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD willshew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come nearunto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near untohim.16:6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 16:7 Andput fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall beholy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israelhath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you nearto himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and tostand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And hehath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Leviwith thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which causeboth thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sentto call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will notcome up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out ofa land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreoverthou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out theeyes of these men? we will not come up.16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect notthou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither haveI hurt one of them.16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company beforethe LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take everyman his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORDevery man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, andAaron, each of you his censer.16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, andlaid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation with Moses and Aaron.16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORDappeared unto all the congregation.16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consumethem in a moment.16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of thespirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth withall the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about thetabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and theelders of Israel followed him.16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lestye be consumed in all their sins.16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the doorof their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their littlechildren.16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent meto do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they bevisited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sentme.16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they godown quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men haveprovoked the LORD.16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all thesewords, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 Andthe earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into thepit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among thecongregation.16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry ofthem: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the twohundred and fifty men that offered incense.16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazarthe son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of theburning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let themmake them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offeredthem before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be asign unto the children of Israel.16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith theythat were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for acovering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children ofIsrael, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come nearto offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as hiscompany: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israelmurmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed thepeople of the LORD.16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered againstMoses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of thecongregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of theLORD appeared.16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of thecongregation.16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up fromamong this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. Andthey fell upon their faces.16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire thereinfrom off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto thecongregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath goneout from the LORD; the plague is begun.16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of thecongregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: andhe put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague wasstayed.16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand andseven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation: and the plague was stayed.17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according tothe house of their fathers, of all their princes according to thehouse of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name uponhis rod.17:3 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for onerod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregationbefore the testimony, where I will meet with you.17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shallchoose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmuringsof the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one oftheir princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according totheir fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron wasamong their rods.17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle ofwitness.17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into thetabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house ofLevi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, andyielded almonds.17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto allthe children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before thetestimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shaltquite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, wedie, we perish, we all perish.17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORDshall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD saidunto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shallbear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with theeshall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thyfather, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, andminister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall ministerbefore the tabernacle of witness.18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all thetabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuaryand the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of thetabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge ofthe altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children ofIsrael.18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from amongthe children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest'soffice for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shallserve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service ofgift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee thecharge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of thechildren of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of theanointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from thefire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, andevery sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirswhich they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and forthy sons.18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eatit: it shall be holy unto thee.18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with allthe wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them untothee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute forever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and ofthe wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto theLORD, them have I given thee.18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bringunto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine houseshall eat of it.18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which theybring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and thefirstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thouredeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or thefirstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shaltsprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for anoffering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and asthe right shoulder are thine.18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the childrenof Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thydaughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of saltfor ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance intheir land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy partand thine inheritance among the children of Israel.18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth inIsrael for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, eventhe service of the tabernacle of the congregation.18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh thetabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be astatute for ever throughout your generations, that among the childrenof Israel they have no inheritance.18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as anheave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel theyshall have no inheritance.18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto theLevites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel thetithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then yeshall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth partof the tithe.18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, asthough it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness ofthe winepress.18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of allyour tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shallgive thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest.18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of theLORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out ofit.18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the bestthereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as theincrease of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: forit is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of thecongregation.18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heavedfrom it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things ofthe children of Israel, lest ye die.19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 Thisis the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heiferwithout spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bringher forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face:19:4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of thecongregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in hissight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall heburn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, andscarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe hisflesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and thepriest shall be unclean until the even.19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, andbathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall bekept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water ofseparation: it is a purification for sin.19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash hisclothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto thechildren of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,for a statute for ever.19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean sevendays.19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on theseventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the thirdday, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.19:13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, andpurifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and thatsoul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation wasnot sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yetupon him.19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come intothe tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.19:15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, isunclean.19:16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in theopen fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall beunclean seven days.19:17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of theburnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be putthereto in a vessel: 19:18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, anddip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all thevessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him thattouched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And theclean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and onthe seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, andwash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean ateven.19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because hehath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hathnot been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.19:21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he thatsprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he thattoucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even.19:22 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; andthe soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode inKadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gatheredthemselves together against Moses and against Aaron.20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would Godthat we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And whyhave ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,that we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have yemade us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;neither is there any water to drink.20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly untothe door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upontheir faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, andgather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, andspeak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth hiswater, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: sothou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together beforethe rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetchyou water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, andwith his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came outabundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed menot, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, thereforeye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have giventhem.20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israelstrove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hathbefallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we havedwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and ourfathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not passthrough the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink ofthe water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will notturn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thyborders.20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I comeout against thee with the sword.20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay forit: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came outagainst him with much people, and with a strong hand.20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:wherefore Israel turned away from him.20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by thecoast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered untohis people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have givenunto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word atthe water of Meribah.20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mountHor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazarhis son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall diethere.20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mountHor in the sight of all the congregation.20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them uponEleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: andMoses and Eleazar came down from the mount.20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, theymourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heardtell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought againstIsrael, and took some of them prisoners.21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wiltindeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroytheir cities.21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered upthe Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: andhe called the name of the place Hormah.21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, tocompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was muchdiscouraged because of the way.21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Whereforehave ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for thereis no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth thislight bread.21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bitthe people; and much people of Israel died.21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, forwe have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for thepeople.21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and setit upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that isbitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and itcame to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld theserpent of brass, he lived.21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in thewilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side ofArnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of theAmorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and theAmorites.21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, Whathe did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at thestream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and liethupon the border of Moab.21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof theLORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will givethem water.21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from thewilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, thatis in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towardJeshimon.21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,saying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into thefields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of thewell: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be pastthy borders.21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out againstIsrael into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought againstIsrael.21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessedhis land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: forthe border of the children of Ammon was strong.21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all thecities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, whohad fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land outof his hand, even unto Arnon.21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a firegone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumedAr of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hathgiven his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity untoSihon king of the Amorites.21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, andwe have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villagesthereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og theking of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to thebattle at Edrei.21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have deliveredhim into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt doto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt atHeshbon.21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until therewas none left him alive: and they possessed his land.22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plainsof Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to theAmorites.22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this companylick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass ofthe field.And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor toPethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of hispeople, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out fromEgypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide overagainst me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me thispeople; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: forI wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursestis cursed.22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with therewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, andspake unto him the words of Balak.22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bringyou word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes ofMoab abode with Balaam.22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,hath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out ofEgypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thoushalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes ofBalak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leaveto go with you.22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, andsaid, Balaam refuseth to come with us.22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable thanthey.22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak theson of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming untome: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I willdo whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curseme this people.22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, IfBalak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot gobeyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that Imay know what the LORD will say unto me more.22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the mencome to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which Ishall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and wentwith the princes of Moab.22:22 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel ofthe LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he wasriding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, andhis sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her intothe way.22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, awall being on this side, and a wall on that side.22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herselfunto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and hesmote her again.22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrowplace, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to theleft.22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down underBalaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with astaff.22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said untoBalaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me thesethree times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hastmocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would Ikill thee.22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon whichthou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wontto do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel ofthe LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and hebowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thousmitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstandthee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for Iknew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, ifit displease thee, I will get me back again.22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: butonly the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. SoBalaam went with the princes of Balak.22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meethim unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is inthe utmost coast.22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto theeto call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeedto promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I amcome unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the wordthat God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to theprinces that were with him.22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, andbrought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might seethe utmost part of the people.23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, andprepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offeredon every altar a bullock and a ram.23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and Iwill go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever hesheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared sevenaltars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return untoBalak, and thus thou shalt speak.23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burntsacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hathbrought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,whom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks Isee him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwellalone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourthpart of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my lastend be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thoudone unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thouhast blessed them altogether.23:12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak thatwhich the LORD hath put in my mouth?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayestsee them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt notsee them all: and curse me them from thence.23:14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top ofPisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram onevery altar.23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, whileI meet the LORD yonder.23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,Go again unto Balak, and say thus.23:17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What haththe LORD spoken?  23:18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 23:19 God is nota man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he shouldrepent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, andshall he not make it good?  23:20 Behold, I have received commandmentto bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.23:21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seenperverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout ofa king is among them.23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strengthof an unicorn.23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is thereany divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be saidof Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!  23:24 Behold, thepeople shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a younglion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink theblood of the slain.23:25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor blessthem at all.23:26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?  23:27 And Balaksaid unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto anotherplace; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me themfrom thence.23:28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that lookethtoward Jeshimon.23:29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, andprepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.23:30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and aram on every altar.24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, hewent not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set hisface toward the wilderness.24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in histents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hathsaid, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:4 He hath said,which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty,falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 24:5 How goodly arethy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!  24:6 As thevalleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as thetrees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar treesbeside the waters.24:7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall bein many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and hiskingdom shall be exalted.24:8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were thestrength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, andshall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shallstir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he thatcurseth thee.24:10 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote hishands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to cursemine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them thesethree times.24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote theeunto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengerswhich thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me hishouse full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment ofthe LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORDsaith, that will I speak?  24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people:come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do tothy people in the latter days.24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beorhath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:16 He hathsaid, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the mostHigh, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, buthaving his eyes open: 24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shallbehold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and aSceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,and destroy all the children of Sheth.24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possessionfor his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shalldestroy him that remaineth of the city.24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be thathe perish for ever.24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shallcarry thee away captive.24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live whenGod doeth this!  24:24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim,and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shallperish for ever.24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: andBalak also went his way.25:1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commitwhoredom with the daughters of Moab.25:2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: andthe people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.25:3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of theLORD was kindled against Israel.25:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people,and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierceanger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.25:5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one hismen that were joined unto Baalpeor.25:6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought untohis brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in thesight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who wereweeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.25:7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron thepriest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took ajavelin in his hand; 25:8 And he went after the man of Israel into thetent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and thewoman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children ofIsrael.25:9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.25:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:11 Phinehas, the sonof Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath awayfrom the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake amongthem, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.25:12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:25:13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenantof an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, andmade an atonement for the children of Israel.25:14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that wasslain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a princeof a chief house among the Simeonites.25:15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi,the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief housein Midian.25:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25:17 Vex the Midianites,and smite them: 25:18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewiththey have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter ofCozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which wasslain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.26:1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake untoMoses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 26:2 Takethe sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twentyyears old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that areable to go to war in Israel.26:3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains ofMoab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 26:4 Take the sum of the people,from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and thechildren of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt.26:5 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch,of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family ofthe Palluites: 26:6 Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi,the family of the Carmites.26:7 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that werenumbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred andthirty.26:8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.26:9 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.

notany of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul,shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her fatherdisallowed her.30:6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or utteredought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 30:7 And herhusband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heardit: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound hersoul shall stand.30:8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she utteredwith her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and theLORD shall forgive her.30:9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewiththey have bound their souls, shall stand against her.30:10 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by abond with an oath; 30:11 And her husband heard it, and held his peaceat her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, andevery bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.30:12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day heheard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning hervows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husbandhath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.30:13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, herhusband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.30:14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day today; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which areupon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in theday that he heard them.30:15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heardthem; then he shall bear her iniquity.30:16 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, betweena man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet inher youth in her father's house.31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 Avenge the childrenof Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thypeople.31:3 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselvesunto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge theLORD of Midian.31:4 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,shall ye send to the war.31:5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, athousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.31:6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, themand Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holyinstruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.31:7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commandedMoses; and they slew all the males.31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them thatwere slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, fivekings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.31:9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and alltheir flocks, and all their goods.31:10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and alltheir goodly castles, with fire.31:11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men andof beasts.31:12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, untoMoses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of thechildren of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are byJordan near Jericho.31:13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of thecongregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.31:14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with thecaptains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came fromthe battle.31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counselof Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and killevery woman that hath known man by lying with him.31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lyingwith him, keep alive for yourselves.31:19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hathkilled any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify bothyourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.31:20 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, andall work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.31:21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went tothe battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commandedMoses; 31:22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, thetin, and the lead, 31:23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shallmake it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless itshall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abidethnot the fire ye shall make go through the water.31:24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shallbe clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.31:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of theprey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar thepriest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 31:27 And dividethe prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, whowent out to battle, and between all the congregation: 31:28 And levy atribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: onesoul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and ofthe asses, and of the sheep: 31:29 Take it of their half, and give itunto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.31:30 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take oneportion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and ofthe flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commandedMoses.31:32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of warhad caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and fivethousand sheep, 31:33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 31:34And threescore and one thousand asses, 31:35 And thirty and twothousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying withhim.31:36 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out towar, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirtythousand and five hundred sheep: 31:37 And the LORD's tribute of thesheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.31:38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'stribute was threescore and twelve.31:39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of whichthe LORD's tribute was threescore and one.31:40 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'stribute was thirty and two persons.31:41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering,unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.31:42 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided fromthe men that warred, 31:43 (Now the half that pertained unto thecongregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seventhousand and five hundred sheep, 31:44 And thirty and six thousandbeeves, 31:45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 31:46 Andsixteen thousand persons;) 31:47 Even of the children of Israel'shalf, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, andgave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle ofthe LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.31:48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, thecaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:31:49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of themen of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one manof us.31:50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what everyman hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before theLORD.31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even allwrought jewels.31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to theLORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.31:53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)31:54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captainsof thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle ofthe congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before theLORD.32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a verygreat multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, andthe land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spakeunto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of thecongregation, saying, 32:3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 32:4 Eventhe country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, isa land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 32:5 Wherefore, saidthey, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given untothy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.32:6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children ofReuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  32:7And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel fromgoing over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thusdid your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw theland, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that theyshould not go into the land which the LORD had given them.32:10 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,saying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, fromtwenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware untoAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not whollyfollowed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, andJoshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.32:13 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he madethem wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increaseof sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towardIsrael.32:15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave themin the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.32:16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfoldshere for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 32:17 But weourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until wehave brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell inthe fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.32:18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israelhave inherited every man his inheritance.32:19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, orforward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordaneastward.32:20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye willgo armed before the LORD to war, 32:21 And will go all of you armedover Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies frombefore him, 32:22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: thenafterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, andbefore Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.32:23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against theLORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.32:24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake untoMoses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 32:27 But thy servants willpass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as mylord saith.32:28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, andJoshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of thechildren of Israel: 32:29 And Moses said unto them, If the children ofGad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, everyman armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subduedbefore you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for apossession: 32:30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, theyshall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.32:32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may beours.32:33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and tothe children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son ofJoseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom ofOg king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,even the cities of the country round about.32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 32:36 AndBethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, andKirjathaim, 32:38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.32:40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and hedwelt therein.32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small townsthereof, and called them Havothjair.32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, andcalled it Nobah, after his own name.33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which wentforth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand ofMoses and Aaron.33:2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys bythe commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according totheir goings out.33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on thefifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover thechildren of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all theEgyptians.33:4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD hadsmitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.33:5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched inSuccoth.33:6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is inthe edge of the wilderness.33:7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.33:8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through themidst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey inthe wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.33:9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim weretwelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and theypitched there.33:10 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.33:11 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in thewilderness of Sin.33:12 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, andencamped in Dophkah.33:13 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.33:14 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where wasno water for the people to drink.33:15 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wildernessof Sinai.33:16 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched atKibrothhattaavah.33:17 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped atHazeroth.33:18 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.33:19 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.33:20 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.33:21 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.33:22 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.33:23 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.33:24 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.33:25 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.33:26 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.33:27 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.33:28 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.33:29 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.33:30 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.33:31 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.33:32 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.33:33 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.33:34 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.33:35 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.33:36 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wildernessof Zin, which is Kadesh.33:37 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in theedge of the land of Edom.33:38 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandmentof the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the childrenof Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of thefifth month.33:39 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when hedied in mount Hor.33:40 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in theland of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.33:41 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.33:42 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.33:43 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.33:44 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in theborder of Moab.33:45 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.33:46 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim.33:47 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in themountains of Abarim, before Nebo.33:48 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched inthe plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.33:49 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even untoAbelshittim in the plains of Moab.33:50 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordannear Jericho, saying, 33:51 Speak unto the children of Israel, and sayunto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;33:52 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land frombefore you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all theirmolten images, and quite pluck down all their high places: 33:53 Andye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein:for I have given you the land to possess it.33:54 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance amongyour families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, andto the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man'sinheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according tothe tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.33:55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land frombefore you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remainof them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, andshall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.33:56 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as Ithought to do unto them.34:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:2 Command the childrenof Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan;(this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, eventhe land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 34:3 Then your southquarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast ofEdom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt seaeastward: 34:4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascentof Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall befrom the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, andpass on to Azmon: 34:5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmonunto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.34:6 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great seafor a border: this shall be your west border.34:7 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shallpoint out for you mount Hor: 34:8 From mount Hor ye shall point outyour border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of theborder shall be to Zedad: 34:9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron,and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be yournorth border.34:10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan toShepham: 34:11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, onthe east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reachunto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 34:12 And the bordershall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the saltsea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.34:13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is theland which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to giveunto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 34:14 For the tribe ofthe children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, andthe tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of theirfathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe ofManasseh have received their inheritance: 34:15 The two tribes and thehalf tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan nearJericho eastward, toward the sunrising.34:16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34:17 These are the namesof the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest,and Joshua the son of Nun.34:18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the landby inheritance.34:19 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Calebthe son of Jephunneh.34:20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son ofAmmihud.34:21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.34:22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki theson of Jogli.34:23 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of thechildren of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.34:24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuelthe son of Shiphtan.34:25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,Elizaphan the son of Parnach.34:26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltielthe son of Azzan.34:27 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud theson of Shelomi.34:28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahelthe son of Ammihud.34:29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritanceunto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.35:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordannear Jericho, saying, 35:2 Command the children of Israel, that theygive unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities todwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for thecities round about them.35:3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs ofthem shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all theirbeasts.35:4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto theLevites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousandcubits round about.35:5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side twothousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on thewest side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousandcubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them thesuburbs of the cities.35:6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites thereshall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for themanslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add fortyand two cities.35:7 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall beforty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.35:8 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession ofthe children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many;but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give ofhis cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which heinheriteth.35:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 35:10 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordaninto the land of Canaan; 35:11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to becities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, whichkilleth any person at unawares.35:12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation injudgment.35:13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye havefor refuge.35:14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three citiesshall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.35:15 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children ofIsrael, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: thatevery one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.35:16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die,he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put todeath.35:18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he maydie, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put todeath.35:19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when hemeeteth him, he shall slay him.35:20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying ofwait, that he die; 35:21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that hedie: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is amurderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when hemeeteth him.35:22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast uponhim any thing without laying of wait, 35:23 Or with any stone,wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that hedie, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 35:24 Then thecongregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of bloodaccording to these judgments: 35:25 And the congregation shall deliverthe slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and thecongregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither hewas fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest,which was anointed with the holy oil.35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border ofthe city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 35:27 And the revenger ofblood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and therevenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:35:28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge untilthe death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priestthe slayer shall return into the land of his possession.35:29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto youthroughout your generations in all your dwellings.35:30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death bythe mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against anyperson to cause him to die.35:31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of amurderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put todeath.35:32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to thecity of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land,until the death of the priest.35:33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood itdefileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood thatis shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.35:34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein Idwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.36:1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead,the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons ofJoseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, thechief fathers of the children of Israel: 36:2 And they said, The LORDcommanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to thechildren of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give theinheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.36:3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes ofthe children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from theinheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of thetribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lotof our inheritance.36:4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, thenshall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribewhereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken awayfrom the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.36:5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the wordof the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.36:6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning thedaughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they thinkbest; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall theymarry.36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel removefrom tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shallkeep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribeof the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of thetribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every manthe inheritance of his fathers.36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to anothertribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shallkeep himself to his own inheritance.36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters ofZelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, andNoah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father'sbrothers' sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of thesons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained inthe tribe of the family of their father.36:13 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORDcommanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in theplains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.The Fifth Book of Moses:  Called Deuteronomy1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this sideJordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea,between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.1:2 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mountSeir unto Kadeshbarnea.)  1:3 And it came to pass in the fortiethyear, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Mosesspake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORDhad given him in commandment unto them; 1:4 After he had slain Sihonthe king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king ofBashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 1:5 On this side Jordan, inthe land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 1:6 TheLORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enoughin this mount: 1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to themount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in theplain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the seaside, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the greatriver, the river Euphrates.1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the landwhich the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, togive unto them and to their seed after them.1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bearyou myself alone: 1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and,behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so manymore as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)  1:12 How canI myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among yourtribes, and I will make them rulers over you.1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken isgood for us to do.1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and madethem heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains overhundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, andofficers among your tribes.1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causesbetween your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and hisbrother, and the stranger that is with him.1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear thesmall as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you,bring it unto me, and I will hear it.1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye shoulddo.1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that greatand terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain ofthe Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came toKadeshbarnea.1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of theAmorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up andpossess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fearnot, neither be discouraged.1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will sendmen before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring usword again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shallcome.1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, oneof a tribe: 1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, andcame unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, andbrought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is agood land which the LORD our God doth give us.1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against thecommandment of the LORD your God: 1:27 And ye murmured in your tents,and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out ofthe land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, todestroy us.1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are greatand walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of theAnakims there.1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 1:31And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy Godbare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,until ye came into this place.1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 1:33 Whowent in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch yourtents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, andin a cloud by day.1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, andsware, saying, 1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of thisevil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto yourfathers.1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him willI give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,because he hath wholly followed the LORD.1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou alsoshalt not go in thither.1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shallgo in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, andyour children, which in that day had no knowledge between good andevil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and theyshall possess it.1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into thewilderness by the way of the Red sea.1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against theLORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our Godcommanded us.And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were readyto go up into the hill.1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neitherfight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled againstthe commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out againstyou, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even untoHormah.1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would nothearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that yeabode there.2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by theway of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mountSeir many days.2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 2:3 Ye have compassed thismountain long enough: turn you northward.2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through thecoast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; andthey shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselvestherefore: 2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of theirland, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mountSeir unto Esau for a possession.2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shallalso buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thyhand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: theseforty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lackednothing.2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and fromEziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neithercontend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their landfor a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot fora possession.2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,and tall, as the Anakims; 2:11 Which also were accounted giants, asthe Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children ofEsau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them,and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of hispossession, which the LORD gave unto them.2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And wewent over the brook Zered.2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we werecome over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all thegeneration of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, asthe LORD sware unto them.2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy themfrom among the host, until they were consumed.2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed anddead from among the people, 2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee ofthe land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have givenit unto the children of Lot for a possession.2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt thereinin old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 2:21 A peoplegreat, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed thembefore them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 2:22As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when hedestroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, anddwelt in their stead even unto this day: 2:23 And the Avims whichdwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forthout of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)  2:24 Riseye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, Ihave given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and hisland: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear ofthee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hearreport of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth untoSihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 2:27 Let me passthrough thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turnunto the right hand nor to the left.2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give mewater for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on myfeet; 2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and theMoabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass overJordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for theLORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, thathe might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon andhis land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit hisland.2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fightat Jahaz.2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,and his sons, and all his people.2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyedthe men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we leftnone to remain: 2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey untoourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and fromthe city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not onecity too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 2:37Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor untoany place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains,nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.3:1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king ofBashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.3:2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him,and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt dounto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt atHeshbon.3:3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king ofBashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left tohim remaining.3:4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a citywhich we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region ofArgob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.3:5 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;beside unwalled towns a great many.3:6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king ofHeshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of everycity.3:7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for aprey to ourselves.3:8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of theAmorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river ofArnon unto mount Hermon; 3:9 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion;and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 3:10 All the cities of the plain,and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of thekingdom of Og in Bashan.3:11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath ofthe children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and fourcubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.3:12 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, whichis by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.3:13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, withall Bashan, which was called the land of giants.3:14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto thecoasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name,Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.3:15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.3:16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gileadeven unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even untothe river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 3:17The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinneretheven unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgaheastward.3:18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hathgiven you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed beforeyour brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.3:19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for Iknow that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which Ihave given you; 3:20 Until the LORD have given rest unto yourbrethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the landwhich the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shallye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.3:21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seenall that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shallthe LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.3:22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight foryou.3:23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 3:24 O Lord GOD,thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mightyhand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can doaccording to thy works, and according to thy might?  3:25 I pray thee,let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, thatgoodly mountain, and Lebanon.3:26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hearme: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more untome of this matter.3:27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyeswestward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold itwith thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.3:28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for heshall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inheritthe land which thou shalt see.3:29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.4:1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto thejudgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and goin and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you.4:2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shallye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of theLORD your God which I command you.4:3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for allthe men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed themfrom among you.4:4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every oneof you this day.4:5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORDmy God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go topossess it.4:6 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and yourunderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all thesestatutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise andunderstanding people.4:7 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them,as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for?  4:8And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments sorighteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?  4:9 Onlytake heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forgetthe things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thyheart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons'sons; 4:10 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thyGod in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the peopletogether, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn tofear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and thatthey may teach their children.4:11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountainburned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, andthick darkness.4:12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: yeheard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard avoice.4:13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you toperform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables ofstone.4:14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes andjudgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over topossess it.4:15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no mannerof similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out ofthe midst of the fire: 4:16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you agraven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male orfemale, 4:17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, thelikeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 4:18 The likenessof any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fishthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 4:19 And lest thou lift upthine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, andthe stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worshipthem, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto allnations under the whole heaven.4:20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of theiron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people ofinheritance, as ye are this day.4:21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swarethat I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in untothat good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:4:22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but yeshall go over, and possess that good land.4:23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of theLORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, orthe likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.4:24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.4:25 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and yeshall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall doevil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 4:26 Icall heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shallsoon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan topossess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterlybe destroyed.4:27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall beleft few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you.4:28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood andstone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.4:29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shaltfind him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.4:30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come uponthee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, andshalt be obedient unto his voice; 4:31 (For the LORD thy God is amerciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, norforget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them.4:32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from theone side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any suchthing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?  4:33 Didever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of thefire, as thou hast heard, and live?  4:34 Or hath God assayed to goand take him a nation from the midst of another nation, bytemptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mightyhand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according toall that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?4:35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD heis God; there is none else beside him.4:36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he mightinstruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thouheardest his words out of the midst of the fire.4:37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seedafter them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty powerout of Egypt; 4:38 To drive out nations from before thee greater andmightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land foran inheritance, as it is this day.4:39 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that theLORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there isnone else.4:40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and withthy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days uponthe earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.4:41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward thesunrising; 4:42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should killhis neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and thatfleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 4:43 Namely, Bezer inthe wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth inGilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.4:44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children ofIsrael: 4:45 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and thejudgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after theycame forth out of Egypt.4:46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in theland of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Mosesand the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out ofEgypt: 4:47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king ofBashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordantoward the sunrising; 4:48 From Aroer, which is by the bank of theriver Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 4:49 And all theplain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain,under the springs of Pisgah.5:1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel,the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, thatye may learn them, and keep, and do them.5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.5:3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,even us, who are all of us here alive this day.5:4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of themidst of the fire, 5:5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time,to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of thefire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 5:6 I am the LORD thyGod, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house ofbondage.5:7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.5:8 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, orthat is in the waters beneath the earth: 5:9 Thou shalt not bow downthyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealousGod, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto thethird and fourth generation of them that hate me, 5:10 And shewingmercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.5:11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for theLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.5:12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hathcommanded thee.5:13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 5:14 But theseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt notdo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant,nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thycattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservantand thy maidservant may rest as well as thou.5:15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, andthat the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty handand by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded theeto keep the sabbath day.5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hathcommanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may gowell with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.5:17 Thou shalt not kill.5:18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.5:19 Neither shalt thou steal.5:20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.5:21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shaltthou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or hismaidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's.5:22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mountout of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness,with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in twotables of stone, and delivered them unto me.5:23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst ofthe darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came nearunto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 5:24 Andye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and hisgreatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire:we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth.5:25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consumeus: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shalldie.5:26 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of theliving God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, andlived?  5:27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shallsay: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak untothee; and we will hear it, and do it.5:28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake untome; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words ofthis people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said allthat they have spoken.5:29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them,and with their children for ever!  5:30 Go say to them, Get you intoyour tents again.5:31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak untothee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, whichthou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I givethem to possess it.5:32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hathcommanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to theleft.5:33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hathcommanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, andthat ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess.6:1 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments,which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do themin the land whither ye go to possess it: 6:2 That thou mightest fearthe LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, whichI command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days ofthy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.6:3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may bewell with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God ofthy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk andhoney.6:4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 6:5 And thou shaltlove the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, andwith all thy might.6:6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thineheart: 6:7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, andshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thouwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.6:8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and theyshall be as frontlets between thine eyes.6:9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thygates.6:10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought theeinto the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thoubuildedst not, 6:11 And houses full of all good things, which thoufilledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards andolive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten andbe full; 6:12 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which broughtthee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.6:13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swearby his name.6:14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people whichare round about you; 6:15 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God amongyou) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, anddestroy thee from off the face of the earth.6:16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him inMassah.6:17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God,and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.6:18 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight ofthe LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go inand possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers.6:19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hathspoken.6:20 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What meanthe testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORDour God hath commanded you?  6:21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, Wewere Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egyptwith a mighty hand: 6:22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, greatand sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, beforeour eyes: 6:23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bringus in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.6:24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear theLORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, asit is at this day.6:25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all thesecommandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.7:1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thougoest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, theHittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nationsgreater and mightier than thou; 7:2 And when the LORD thy God shalldeliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroythem; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:7:3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thoushalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thyson.7:4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they mayserve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled againstyou, and destroy thee suddenly.7:5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars,and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn theirgraven images with fire.7:6 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thyGod hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above allpeople that are upon the face of the earth.7:7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because yewere more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of allpeople: 7:8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keepthe oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD broughtyou out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house ofbondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.7:9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God,which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep hiscommandments to a thousand generations; 7:10 And repayeth them thathate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to himthat hateth him, he will repay him to his face.7:11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, andthe judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.7:12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to thesejudgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keepunto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:7:13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he willalso bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn,and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocksof thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to givethee.7:14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be maleor female barren among you, or among your cattle.7:15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will putnone of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; butwill lay them upon all them that hate thee.7:16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy Godshall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neithershalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.7:17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I;how can I dispossess them?  7:18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: butshalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and untoall Egypt; 7:19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and thesigns, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched outarm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thyGod do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.7:20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, untilthey that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.7:21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God isamong you, a mighty God and terrible.7:22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee bylittle and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest thebeasts of the field increase upon thee.7:23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shalldestroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.7:24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shaltdestroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able tostand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.7:25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thoushalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it untothee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORDthy God.7:26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lestthou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, andthou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.8:1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall yeobserve to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possessthe land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.8:2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God ledthee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to provethee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep hiscommandments, or no.8:3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed theewith manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; thathe might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but byevery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.8:4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell,these forty years.8:5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chastenethhis son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.8:6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, towalk in his ways, and to fear him.8:7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land ofbrooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleysand hills; 8:8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees,and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 8:9 A land whereinthou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thingin it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thoumayest dig brass.8:10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORDthy God for the good land which he hath given thee.8:11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping hiscommandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I commandthee this day: 8:12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hastbuilt goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 8:13 And when thy herds andthy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, andall that thou hast is multiplied; 8:14 Then thine heart be lifted up,and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of theland of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 8:15 Who led thee throughthat great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, andscorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought theeforth water out of the rock of flint; 8:16 Who fed thee in thewilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he mighthumble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thylatter end; 8:17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the mightof mine hand hath gotten me this wealth.8:18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he thatgiveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenantwhich he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.8:19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, andwalk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testifyagainst you this day that ye shall surely perish.8:20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, soshall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice ofthe LORD your God.9:1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in topossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great andfenced up to heaven, 9:2 A people great and tall, the children of theAnakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who canstand before the children of Anak!  9:3 Understand therefore this day,that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as aconsuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them downbefore thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy themquickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.9:4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hathcast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORDhath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness ofthese nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.9:5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart,dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of thesenations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, andthat he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers,Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.9:6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not thisgood land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art astiffnecked people.9:7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God towrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out ofthe land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have beenrebellious against the LORD.9:8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD wasangry with you to have destroyed you.9:9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone,even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then Iabode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eatbread nor drink water: 9:10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tablesof stone written with the finger of God; and on them was writtenaccording to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mountout of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.9:11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of thecovenant.9:12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly fromhence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt havecorrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the waywhich I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.9:13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen thispeople, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 9:14 Let me alone,that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven:and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.9:15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burnedwith fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.9:16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD yourGod, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly outof the way which the LORD had commanded you.9:17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, andbrake them before your eyes.9:18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days andforty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of allyour sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD,to provoke him to anger.9:19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith theLORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened untome at that time also.9:20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: andI prayed for Aaron also the same time.9:21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt itwith fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it wasas small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook thatdescended out of the mount.9:22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, yeprovoked the LORD to wrath.9:23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go upand possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled againstthe commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, norhearkened to his voice.9:24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knewyou.9:25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, asI fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroyyou.9:26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroynot thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed throughthy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with amighty hand.9:27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not untothe stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to theirsin: 9:28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because theLORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them,and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them inthe wilderness.9:29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thoubroughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.10:1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stonelike unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make theean ark of wood.10:2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the firsttables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.10:3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stonelike unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tablesin mine hand.10:4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, theten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out ofthe midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gavethem unto me.10:5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put thetables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORDcommanded me.10:6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of thechildren of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he wasburied; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in hisstead.10:7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah toJotbath, a land of rivers of waters.10:8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear theark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to ministerunto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.10:9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promisedhim.10:10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, fortydays and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that timealso, and the LORD would not destroy thee.10:11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before thepeople, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware untotheir fathers to give unto them.10:12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, butto fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him,and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thysoul, 10:13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes,which I command thee this day for thy good?  10:14 Behold, the heavenand the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, withall that therein is.10:15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and hechose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is thisday.10:16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no morestiffnecked.10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a greatGod, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor takethreward: 10:18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless andwidow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.10:19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in theland of Egypt.10:20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and tohim shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.10:21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for theethese great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.10:22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and tenpersons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars ofheaven for multitude.11:1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge,and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.11:2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children whichhave not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORDyour God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,11:3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst ofEgypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 11:4 Andwhat he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to theirchariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them asthey pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto thisday; 11:5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye cameinto this place; 11:6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sonsof Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, andswallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all thesubstance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:11:7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which hedid.11:8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command youthis day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land,whither ye go to possess it; 11:9 And that ye may prolong your days inthe land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them andto their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.11:10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as theland of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed,and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11:11 But theland, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, anddrinketh water of the rain of heaven: 11:12 A land which the LORD thyGod careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, fromthe beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.11:13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently untomy commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD yourGod, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,11:14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thycorn, and thy wine, and thine oil.11:15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thoumayest eat and be full.11:16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and yeturn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 11:17 And then theLORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, thatthere be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest yeperish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.11:18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and inyour soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may beas frontlets between your eyes.11:19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them whenthou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, whenthou liest down, and when thou risest up.11:20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,and upon thy gates: 11:21 That your days may be multiplied, and thedays of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto yourfathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.11:22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which Icommand you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all hisways, and to cleave unto him; 11:23 Then will the LORD drive out allthese nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nationsand mightier than yourselves.11:24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall beyours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the riverEuphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.11:25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORDyour God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all theland that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.11:26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 11:27A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which Icommand you this day: 11:28 And a curse, if ye will not obey thecommandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way whichI command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have notknown.11:29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath broughtthee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thoushalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mountEbal.11:30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sungoeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in thechampaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?  11:31 Forye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORDyour God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.11:32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments whichI set before you this day.12:1 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe todo in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee topossess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.12:2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nationswhich ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, andupon the hills, and under every green tree: 12:3 And ye shalloverthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groveswith fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, anddestroy the names of them out of that place.12:4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.12:5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out ofall your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shallye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 12:6 And thither ye shall bringyour burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heaveofferings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings,and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 12:7 And there yeshall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all thatye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thyGod hath blessed thee.12:8 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.12:9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,which the LORD your God giveth you.12:10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORDyour God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from allyour enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 12:11 Then thereshall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause hisname to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heaveoffering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto theLORD: 12:12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, andyour sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and yourmaidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch ashe hath no part nor inheritance with you.12:13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings inevery place that thou seest: 12:14 But in the place which the LORDshall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burntofferings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.12:15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of theLORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean mayeat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.12:16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earthas water.12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, orof thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thyflock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewillofferings, or heave offering of thine hand: 12:18 But thou must eatthem before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shallchoose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, andthy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thoushalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thinehands unto.12:19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long asthou livest upon the earth.12:20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hathpromised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soullongeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soullusteth after.12:21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his namethere be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and ofthy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee,and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.12:22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eatthem: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.12:23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is thelife; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.12:24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth aswater.12:25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and withthy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in thesight of the LORD.12:26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalttake, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 12:27 Andthou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, uponthe altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shallbe poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eatthe flesh.12:28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that itmay go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, whenthou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thyGod.12:29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from beforethee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them,and dwellest in their land; 12:30 Take heed to thyself that thou benot snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from beforethee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How didthese nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.12:31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for everyabomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto theirgods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in thefire to their gods.12:32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shaltnot add thereto, nor diminish from it.13:1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, andgiveth thee a sign or a wonder, 13:2 And the sign or the wonder cometo pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after othergods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 13:3 Thoushalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer ofdreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love theLORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.13:4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep hiscommandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleaveunto him.13:5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put todeath; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God,which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out ofthe house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thyGod commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away fromthe midst of thee.13:6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thydaughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thineown soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve othergods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 13:7 Namely,of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee,or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto theother end of the earth; 13:8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, norhearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thouspare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 13:9 But thou shalt surely killhim; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, andafterwards the hand of all the people.13:10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because hehath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which broughtthee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.13:11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more anysuch wickedness as this is among you.13:12 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thyGod hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 13:13 Certain men, thechildren of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawnthe inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,which ye have not known; 13:14 Then shalt thou enquire, and makesearch, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thingcertain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 13:15 Thou shaltsurely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword,destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattlethereof, with the edge of the sword.13:16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of thestreet thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoilthereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap forever; it shall not be built again.13:17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand:that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew theemercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hathsworn unto thy fathers; 13:18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice ofthe LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command theethis day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.14:1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cutyourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.14:2 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORDhath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all thenations that are upon the earth.14:3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.14:4 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, andthe goat, 14:5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and thewild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.14:6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleftinto two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shalleat.14:7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, orof them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, andthe coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; thereforethey are unclean unto you.14:8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not thecud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nortouch their dead carcase.14:9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that havefins and scales shall ye eat: 14:10 And whatsoever hath not fins andscales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.14:11 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.14:12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and theossifrage, and the ospray, 14:13 And the glede, and the kite, and thevulture after his kind, 14:14 And every raven after his kind, 14:15And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk afterhis kind, 14:16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 14:17And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 14:18 And thestork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.14:19 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: theyshall not be eaten.14:20 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.14:21 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shaltgive it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; orthou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people untothe LORD thy God.Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.14:22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that thefield bringeth forth year by year.14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place whichhe shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thywine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thyflocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.14:24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not ableto carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thyGod shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hathblessed thee: 14:25 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind upthe money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORDthy God shall choose: 14:26 And thou shalt bestow that money forwhatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or forwine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: andthou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice,thou, and thine household, 14:27 And the Levite that is within thygates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritancewith thee.14:28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the titheof thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates:14:29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance withthee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which arewithin thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that theLORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thoudoest.15:1 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.15:2 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor thatlendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exactit of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called theLORD's release.15:3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which isthine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 15:4 Save when thereshall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee inthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance topossess it: 15:5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of theLORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I commandthee this day.15:6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thoushalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thoushalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.15:7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren withinany of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thoushalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poorbrother: 15:8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shaltsurely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.15:9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying,The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye beevil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cryunto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee.15:10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grievedwhen thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thyGod shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttestthine hand unto.15:11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore Icommand thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thybrother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.15:12 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be soldunto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thoushalt let him go free from thee.15:13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not lethim go away empty: 15:14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thyflock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of thatwherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.15:15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land ofEgypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command theethis thing to day.15:16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away fromthee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well withthee; 15:17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his earunto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thymaidservant thou shalt do likewise.15:18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him awayfree from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee,in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee inall that thou doest.15:19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flockthou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work withthe firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep.15:20 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in theplace which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.15:21 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or blind,or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thyGod.15:22 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the cleanperson shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.15:23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour itupon the ground as water.16:1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORDthy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forthout of Egypt by night.16:2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thyGod, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shallchoose to place his name there.16:3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thoueat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thoucamest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayestremember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt allthe days of thy life.16:4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thycoast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, whichthou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until themorning.16:5 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates,which the LORD thy God giveth thee: 16:6 But at the place which theLORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shaltsacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at theseason that thou camest forth out of Egypt.16:7 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thyGod shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thytents.16:8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh dayshall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no worktherein.16:9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number theseven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to thecorn.16:10 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy Godwith a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shaltgive unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessedthee: 16:11 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, andthy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant,and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and thefatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which theLORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.16:12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: andthou shalt observe and do these statutes.16:13 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, afterthat thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 16:14 And thou shaltrejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thymanservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the stranger, and thefatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.16:15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy Godin the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy Godshall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thinehands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.16:16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORDthy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavenedbread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: andthey shall not appear before the LORD empty: 16:17 Every man shallgive as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy Godwhich he hath given thee.16:18 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, whichthe LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shalljudge the people with just judgment.16:19 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, andpervert the words of the righteous.16:20 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thoumayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.16:21 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto thealtar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.16:22 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy Godhateth.17:1 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, orsheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that is anabomination unto the LORD thy God.17:2 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which theLORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickednessin the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 17:3And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either thesun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have notcommanded; 17:4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, andenquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,that such abomination is wrought in Israel: 17:5 Then shalt thou bringforth that man or that woman, which have committed that wicked thing,unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them withstones, till they die.17:6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he thatis worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness heshall not be put to death.17:7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him todeath, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt putthe evil away from among you.17:8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, betweenblood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke,being matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise,and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose;17:9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto thejudge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shewthee the sentence of judgment: 17:10 And thou shalt do according tothe sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall chooseshall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do according to all thatthey inform thee: 17:11 According to the sentence of the law whichthey shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shalltell thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentencewhich they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the left.17:12 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearkenunto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thyGod, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt putaway the evil from Israel.17:13 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no morepresumptuously.17:14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveththee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, Iwill set a king over me, like as all the nations that are about me;17:15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thyGod shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king overthee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thybrother.17:16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause thepeople to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth returnno more that way.17:17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turnnot away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver andgold.17:18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom,that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that whichis before the priests the Levites: 17:19 And it shall be with him, andhe shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn tofear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and thesestatutes, to do them: 17:20 That his heart be not lifted up above hisbrethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to theright hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days inhis kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.18:1 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have nopart nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of theLORD made by fire, and his inheritance.18:2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.18:3 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from themthat offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they shall giveunto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.18:4 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.18:5 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, tostand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.18:6 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto theplace which the LORD shall choose; 18:7 Then he shall minister in thename of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, whichstand there before the LORD.18:8 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh ofthe sale of his patrimony.18:9 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveththee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of thosenations.18:10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his sonor his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, oran observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.18:11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard,or a necromancer.18:12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them outfrom before thee.18:13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.18:14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened untoobservers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thyGod hath not suffered thee so to do.18:15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from themidst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shallhearken; 18:16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thyGod in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear againthe voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire anymore, that I die not.18:17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which theyhave spoken.18:18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, likeunto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak untothem all that I shall command him.18:19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken untomy words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.18:20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name,which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in thename of other gods, even that prophet shall die.18:21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word whichthe LORD hath not spoken?  18:22 When a prophet speaketh in the nameof the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is thething which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken itpresumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.19:1 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land theLORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest intheir cities, and in their houses; 19:2 Thou shalt separate threecities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy Godgiveth thee to possess it.19:3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land,which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, thatevery slayer may flee thither.19:4 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom hehated not in time past; 19:5 As when a man goeth into the wood withhis neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axeto cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, andlighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one ofthose cities, and live: 19:6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue theslayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way islong, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as hehated him not in time past.19:7 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate threecities for thee.19:8 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn untothy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give untothy fathers; 19:9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to dothem, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and towalk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee,beside these three: 19:10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land,which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood beupon thee.19:11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, andrise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleethinto one of these cities: 19:12 Then the elders of his city shall sendand fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger ofblood, that he may die.19:13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guiltof innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.19:14 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they ofold time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit inthe land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.19:15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, orfor any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of twowitnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter beestablished.19:16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify againsthim that which is wrong; 19:17 Then both the men, between whom thecontroversy is, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests andthe judges, which shall be in those days; 19:18 And the judges shallmake diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a falsewitness, and hath testified falsely against his brother; 19:19 Thenshall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother:so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.19:20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shallhenceforth commit no more any such evil among you.19:21 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eyefor eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.20:1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seesthorses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid ofthem: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out ofthe land of Egypt.20:2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that thepriest shall approach and speak unto the people, 20:3 And shall sayunto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle againstyour enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,neither be ye terrified because of them; 20:4 For the LORD your God ishe that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to saveyou.20:5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man isthere that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let himgo and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another mandedicate it.20:6 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not yeteaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house, lest he die inthe battle, and another man eat of it.20:7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath nottaken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in thebattle, and another man take her.20:8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and theyshall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted? let himgo and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as wellas his heart.20:9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speakingunto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to leadthe people.20:10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, thenproclaim peace unto it.20:11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open untothee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found thereinshall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.20:12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make waragainst thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 20:13 And when the LORD thyGod hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every malethereof with the edge of the sword: 20:14 But the women, and thelittle ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all thespoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat thespoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.20:15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far offfrom thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.20:16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God dothgive thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing thatbreatheth: 20:17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, theHittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, theHivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:20:18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against theLORD your God.20:19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making waragainst it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof byforcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thoushalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man's life) toemploy them in the siege: 20:20 Only the trees which thou knowest thatthey be not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; andthou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,until it be subdued.21:1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveththee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hathslain him: 21:2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, andthey shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that isslain: 21:3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto theslain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, whichhath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 21:4And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a roughvalley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off theheifer's neck there in the valley: 21:5 And the priests the sons ofLevi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen tominister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by theirword shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 21:6 And allthe elders of that city, that are next unto the slain man, shall washtheir hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 21:7 Andthey shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neitherhave our eyes seen it.21:8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hastredeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel'scharge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.21:9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from amongyou, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD.21:10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORDthy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken themcaptive, 21:11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, andhast a desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 21:12Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave herhead, and pare her nails; 21:13 And she shall put the raiment of hercaptivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewailher father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt goin unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shaltlet her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all formoney, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hasthumbled her.21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, andthey have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and ifthe firstborn son be hers that was hated: 21:16 Then it shall be, whenhe maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not makethe son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which isindeed the firstborn: 21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of thehated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that hehath: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of thefirstborn is his.21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obeythe voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, whenthey have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 21:19 Then shallhis father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto theelders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 21:20 And theyshall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn andrebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and adrunkard.21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that hedie: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shallhear, and fear.21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be tobe put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 21:23 His body shall notremain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury himthat day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land benot defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.22:1 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, andhide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again untothy brother.22:2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know himnot, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall bewith thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore itto him again.22:3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou dowith his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which hehath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayestnot hide thyself.22:4 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by theway, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to liftthem up again.22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so areabomination unto the LORD thy God.22:6 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree,or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the damsitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the damwith the young: 22:7 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, andtake the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thoumayest prolong thy days.22:8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlementfor thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any manfall from thence.22:9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruitof thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, bedefiled.22:10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.22:11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen andlinen together.22:12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thyvesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.22:13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 22:14And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil nameupon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I foundher not a maid: 22:15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and hermother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity untothe elders of the city in the gate: 22:16 And the damsel's fathershall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife,and he hateth her; 22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speechagainst her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet theseare the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread thecloth before the elders of the city.22:18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastisehim; 22:19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver,and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath broughtup an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; hemay not put her away all his days.22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be notfound for the damsel: 22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel tothe door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stoneher with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly inIsrael, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou putevil away from among you.22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, thenthey shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, andthe woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and aman find her in the city, and lie with her; 22:24 Then ye shall bringthem both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them withstones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in thecity; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: sothou shalt put away evil from among you.22:25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the manforce her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shalldie.22:26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in thedamsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against hisneighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: 22:27 For he foundher in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was noneto save her.22:28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed,and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 22:29 Thenthe man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fiftyshekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbledher, he may not put her away all his days.22:30 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover hisfather's skirt.23:1 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cutoff, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.23:2 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; evento his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation ofthe LORD.23:3 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation ofthe LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into thecongregation of the LORD for ever: 23:4 Because they met you not withbread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; andbecause they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor ofMesopotamia, to curse thee.23:5 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; butthe LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, becausethe LORD thy God loved thee.23:6 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy daysfor ever.23:7 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thoushalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land.23:8 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into thecongregation of the LORD in their third generation.23:9 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep theefrom every wicked thing.23:10 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason ofuncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out ofthe camp, he shall not come within the camp: 23:11 But it shall be,when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself with water: and when thesun is down, he shall come into the camp again.23:12 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thoushalt go forth abroad: 23:13 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thyweapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thoushalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which comethfrom thee: 23:14 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thycamp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing inthee, and turn away from thee.23:15 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which isescaped from his master unto thee: 23:16 He shall dwell with thee,even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thygates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.23:17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor asodomite of the sons of Israel.23:18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog,into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both theseare abomination unto the LORD thy God.23:19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: 23:20Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thoushalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in allthat thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest topossess it.23:21 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt notslack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee;and it would be sin in thee.23:22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.23:23 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform;even a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORDthy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.23:24 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayesteat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put anyin thy vessel.23:25 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, thenthou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move asickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.24:1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come topass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found someuncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, andgive it in her hand, and send her out of his house.24:2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and beanother man's wife.24:3 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill ofdivorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of hishouse; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;24:4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her againto be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abominationbefore the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which theLORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.24:5 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be free athome one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.24:6 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:for he taketh a man's life to pledge.24:7 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children ofIsrael, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him;

for he is poor, and setteth hisheart upon it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sinunto thee.24:16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neithershall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall beput to death for his own sin.24:17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of thefatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge: 24:18 But thou shaltremember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy Godredeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.24:19 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hastforgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: itshall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: thatthe LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.24:20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over theboughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, andfor the widow.24:21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt notglean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless,and for the widow.24:22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land ofEgypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.25:1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come untojudgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify therighteous, and condemn the wicked.25:2 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten, thatthe judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before hisface, according to his fault, by a certain number.25:3 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he shouldexceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brothershould seem vile unto thee.25:4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.25:5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have nochild, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger:her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him towife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her.25:6 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shallsucceed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his name be notput out of Israel.25:7 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let hisbrother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, Myhusband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name inIsrael, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.25:8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him:and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her; 25:9 Thenshall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of the elders,and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shallanswer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not buildup his brother's house.25:10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him thathath his shoe loosed.25:11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of theone draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of himthat smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by thesecrets: 25:12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall notpity her.25:13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and asmall.25:14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great anda small.25:15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect andjust measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in theland which the LORD thy God giveth thee.25:16 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously, arean abomination unto the LORD thy God.25:17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were comeforth out of Egypt; 25:18 How he met thee by the way, and smote thehindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thouwast faint and weary; and he feared not God.25:19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given theerest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORDthy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it, that thou shaltblot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt notforget it.26:1 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which theLORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, anddwellest therein; 26:2 That thou shalt take of the first of all thefruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORDthy God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go untothe place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there.26:3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I amcome unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for togive us.26:4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and setit down before the altar of the LORD thy God.26:5 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrianready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, andsojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty,and populous: 26:6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflictedus, and laid upon us hard bondage: 26:7 And when we cried unto theLORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on ouraffliction, and our labour, and our oppression: 26:8 And the LORDbrought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with anoutstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, andwith wonders: 26:9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hathgiven us this land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.26:10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before theLORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God: 26:11 And thoushalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath givenunto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and thestranger that is among you.26:12 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thineincrease the third year, which is the year of tithing, and hast givenit unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, thatthey may eat within thy gates, and be filled; 26:13 Then thou shaltsay before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed thingsout of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and untothe stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to allthy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressedthy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.26:14 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I takenaway ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof forthe dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, andhave done according to all that thou hast commanded me.26:15 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thypeople Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarestunto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.26:16 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do thesestatutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with allthine heart, and with all thy soul.26:17 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walkin his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and hisjudgments, and to hearken unto his voice: 26:18 And the LORD hathavouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promisedthee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; 26:19 And tomake thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and inname, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto theLORD thy God, as he hath spoken.27:1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.27:2 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan untothe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set theeup great stones, and plaister them with plaister: 27:3 And thou shaltwrite upon them all the words of this law, when thou art passed over,that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveththee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thyfathers hath promised thee.27:4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye shallset up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, andthou shalt plaister them with plaister.27:5 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, analtar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them.27:6 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones:and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God:27:7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, andrejoice before the LORD thy God.27:8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this lawvery plainly.27:9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become thepeople of the LORD thy God.27:10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and dohis commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.27:11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 27:12 Theseshall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are comeover Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph,and Benjamin: 27:13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse;Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.27:14 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israelwith a loud voice, 27:15 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven ormolten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands ofthe craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the peopleshall answer and say, Amen.27:16 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.

for the locust shall consume it.28:39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neitherdrink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eatthem.28:40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thoushalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast hisfruit.28:41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoythem; for they shall go into captivity.28:42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.28:43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee veryhigh; and thou shalt come down very low.28:44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shallbe the head, and thou shalt be the tail.28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursuethee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thouhearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep hiscommandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: 28:46 And theyshall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed forever.28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, andwith gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things; 28:48Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall sendagainst thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in wantof all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until hehave destroyed thee.28:49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from theend of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tonguethou shalt not understand; 28:50 A nation of fierce countenance, whichshall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:28:51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thyland, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee eithercorn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thysheep, until he have destroyed thee.28:52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high andfenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thyland: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thyland, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thysons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, inthe siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shalldistress thee: 28:54 So that the man that is tender among you, andvery delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and towardthe wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which heshall leave: 28:55 So that he will not give to any of them of theflesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing lefthim in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shalldistress thee in all thy gates.28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would notadventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicatenessand tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom,and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 28:57 And toward heryoung one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward herchildren which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of allthings secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemyshall distress thee in thy gates.28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law thatare written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious andfearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 28:59 Then the LORD will make thyplagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues,and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written inthe book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thoube destroyed.28:62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the starsof heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice ofthe LORD thy God.28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you todo you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you todestroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked fromoff the land whither thou goest to possess it.28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the oneend of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve othergods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood andstone.28:65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shallthe sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there atrembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 28:66 Andthy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day andnight, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 28:67 In the morningthou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say,Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thoushalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.28:68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, bythe way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again:and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen andbondwomen, and no man shall buy you.29:1 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commandedMoses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besidethe covenant which he made with them in Horeb.29:2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye haveseen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt untoPharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 29:3 Thegreat temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and thosegreat miracles: 29:4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart toperceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.29:5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothesare not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thyfoot.29:6 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strongdrink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.29:7 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, andOg the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smotethem: 29:8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance untothe Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh.29:9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that yemay prosper in all that ye do.29:10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; yourcaptains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all themen of Israel, 29:11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy strangerthat is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thywater: 29:12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thyGod, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee thisday: 29:13 That he may establish thee to day for a people untohimself, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said untothee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, andto Jacob.29:14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;29:15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORDour God, and also with him that is not here with us this day: 29:16(For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we camethrough the nations which ye passed by; 29:17 And ye have seen theirabominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, whichwere among them:) 29:18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman,or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORDour God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there shouldbe among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; 29:19 And it cometo pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he blesshimself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in theimagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 29:20 TheLORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and hisjealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that arewritten in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot outhis name from under heaven.29:21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribesof Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that arewritten in this book of the law: 29:22 So that the generation to comeof your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger thatshall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues ofthat land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; 29:23And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning,that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, likethe overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which theLORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 29:24 Even all nationsshall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? whatmeaneth the heat of this great anger?  29:25 Then men shall say,Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of theirfathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of theland of Egypt: 29:26 For they went and served other gods, andworshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not givenunto them: 29:27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against thisland, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:29:28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and inwrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, asit is this day.29:29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those thingswhich are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, thatwe may do all the words of this law.30:1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come uponthee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, andthou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither the LORDthy God hath driven thee, 30:2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God,and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee thisday, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thysoul; 30:3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, andhave compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from allthe nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.30:4 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven,from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will hefetch thee: 30:5 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the landwhich thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will dothee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.30:6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heartof thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and withall thy soul, that thou mayest live.30:7 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thineenemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.30:8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do allhis commandments which I command thee this day.30:9 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work ofthine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle,and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will againrejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 30:10 Ifthou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep hiscommandments and his statutes which are written in this book of thelaw, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, andwith all thy soul.30:11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is nothidden from thee, neither is it far off.30:12 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go upfor us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and doit?  30:13 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Whoshall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hearit, and do it?  30:14 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thymouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.30:15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and deathand evil; 30:16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thyGod, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and hisstatutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: andthe LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest topossess it.30:17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, butshalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 30:18 Idenounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that yeshall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest overJordan to go to possess it.30:19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that Ihave set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: thereforechoose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 30:20 That thoumayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice, andthat thou mayest cleave unto him: for he is thy life, and the lengthof thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD swareunto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.31:1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.31:2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old thisday; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said untome, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.31:3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he willdestroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them:and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said.31:4 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.31:5 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may dounto them according unto all the commandments which I have commandedyou.31:6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will notfail thee, nor forsake thee.31:7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight ofall Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go withthis people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathersto give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.31:8 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be withthee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neitherbe dismayed.31:9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests thesons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and untoall the elders of Israel.31:10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every sevenyears, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast oftabernacles, 31:11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORDthy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this lawbefore all Israel in their hearing.31:12 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and thystranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that theymay learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the wordsof this law: 31:13 And that their children, which have not known anything, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as yelive in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.31:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach thatthou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacleof the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses andJoshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of thecongregation.31:15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud:and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.31:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thyfathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the godsof the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, andwill forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.31:17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and Iwill forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shallbe devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so thatthey will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, becauseour God is not among us?  31:18 And I will surely hide my face in thatday for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they areturned unto other gods.31:19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it thechildren of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be awitness for me against the children of Israel.31:20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swareunto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shallhave eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turnunto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break mycovenant.31:21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles arebefallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for Iknow their imagination which they go about, even now, before I havebrought them into the land which I sware.31:22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it thechildren of Israel.31:23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strongand of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israelinto the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.31:24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing thewords of this law in a book, until they were finished, 31:25 ThatMoses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of theLORD, saying, 31:26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the sideof the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be therefor a witness against thee.31:27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I amyet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD;and how much more after my death?  31:28 Gather unto me all the eldersof your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words intheir ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.31:29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corruptyourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evilin the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work ofyour hands.31:30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israelthe words of this song, until they were ended.32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, thewords of my mouth.32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as thedew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers uponthe grass: 32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribeye greatness unto our God.32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways arejudgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of hischildren: they are a perverse and crooked generation.32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is nothe thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, andestablished thee?  32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the yearsof many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thyelders, and they will tell thee.32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, whenhe separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the peopleaccording to the number of the children of Israel.32:9 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of hisinheritance.32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howlingwilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as theapple of his eye.32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange godwith him.32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he mighteat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out ofthe rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 32:14 Butter of kine, andmilk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, andgoats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pureblood of the grape.32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou artgrown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God whichmade him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, withabominations provoked they him to anger.32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knewnot, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hastforgotten God that formed thee.32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of theprovoking of his sons, and of his daughters.32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see whattheir end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, childrenin whom is no faith.32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; theyhave provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them tojealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them toanger with a foolish nation.32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto thelowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set onfire the foundations of the mountains.32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows uponthem.32:24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts uponthem, with the poison of serpents of the dust.32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both theyoung man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of grayhairs.32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make theremembrance of them to cease from among men: 32:27 Were it not that Ifeared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behavethemselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, andthe LORD hath not done all this.32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there anyunderstanding in them.32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that theywould consider their latter end!  32:30 How should one chase athousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock hadsold them, and the LORD had shut them up?  32:31 For their rock is notas our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields ofGomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom ofasps.32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among mytreasures?  32:35 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their footshall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, andthe things that shall come upon them make haste.32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for hisservants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is noneshut up, or left.32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom theytrusted, 32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drankthe wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, andbe your protection.32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: Ikill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any thatcan deliver out of my hand.32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold onjudgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will rewardthem that hate me.32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shalldevour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of thecaptives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge theblood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the earsof the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words whichI testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children toobserve to do, all the words of this law.32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: andthrough this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither yego over Jordan to possess it.32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 32:49Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is inthe land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land ofCanaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered untothy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gatheredunto his people: 32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among thechildren of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wildernessof Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children ofIsrael.32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not gothither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.33:1 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessedthe children of Israel before his death.33:2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir untothem; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousandsof saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.33:3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: andthey sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.33:4 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of thecongregation of Jacob.33:5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and thetribes of Israel were gathered together.33:6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.33:7 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, thevoice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands besufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.33:8 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thyholy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didststrive at the waters of Meribah; 33:9 Who said unto his father and tohis mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge hisbrethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word,and kept thy covenant.33:10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: theyshall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thinealtar.33:11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of themthat hate him, that they rise not again.33:12 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell insafety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and heshall dwell between his shoulders.33:13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for theprecious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that couchethbeneath, 33:14 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun,and for the precious things put forth by the moon, 33:15 And for thechief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things ofthe lasting hills, 33:16 And for the precious things of the earth andfulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush:let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of thehead of him that was separated from his brethren.33:17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his hornsare like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the peopletogether to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands ofEphraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.33:18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,Issachar, in thy tents.33:19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shalloffer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of theabundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.33:20 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: hedwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.33:21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in aportion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads ofthe people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgmentswith Israel.33:22 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap fromBashan.33:23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, andfull with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and thesouth.33:24 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; lethim be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.33:25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thystrength be.33:26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon theheaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.33:27 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are theeverlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;and shall say, Destroy them.33:28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacobshall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall dropdown dew.33:29 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people savedby the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thyexcellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thoushalt tread upon their high places.34:1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain ofNebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the LORDshewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 34:2 And all Naphtali,and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, untothe utmost sea, 34:3 And the south, and the plain of the valley ofJericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.34:4 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware untoAbraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thyseed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt notgo over thither.34:5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,according to the word of the LORD.34:6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over againstBethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.34:7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: hiseye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.34:8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moabthirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.34:9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; forMoses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israelhearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.34:10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,whom the LORD knew face to face, 34:11 In all the signs and thewonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt toPharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 34:12 And inall that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewedin the sight of all Israel.The Book of Joshua1:1 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came topass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,saying, 1:2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go overthis Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do giveto them, even to the children of Israel.1:3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that haveI given unto you, as I said unto Moses.1:4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river,the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the greatsea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.1:5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the daysof thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will notfail thee, nor forsake thee.1:6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thoudivide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathersto give them.1:7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observeto do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee:turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayestprosper withersoever thou goest.1:8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thoushalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to doaccording to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thyway prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.1:9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be notafraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with theewhithersoever thou goest.1:10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 1:11Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare youvictuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to goin to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possessit.1:12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribeof Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 1:13 Remember the word which Mosesthe servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hathgiven you rest, and hath given you this land.1:14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain inthe land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall passbefore your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and helpthem; 1:15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hathgiven you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD yourGod giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of yourpossession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave you onthis side Jordan toward the sunrising.1:16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us wewill do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.1:17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will wehearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was withMoses.1:18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and willnot hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shallbe put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.2:1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spysecretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, andcame into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there.2:2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there camemen in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out thecountry.2:3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth themen that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: forthey be come to search out all the country.2:4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, Therecame men unto me, but I wist not whence they were: 2:5 And it came topass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, thatthe men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after themquickly; for ye shall overtake them.2:6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid themwith the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.2:7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords:and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shutthe gate.2:8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon theroof; 2:9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath givenyou the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all theinhabitants of the land faint because of you.2:10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red seafor you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kingsof the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og,whom ye utterly destroyed.2:11 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you:for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earthbeneath.2:12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since Ihave shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto myfather's house, and give me a true token: 2:13 And that ye will savealive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, andall that they have, and deliver our lives from death.2:14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter notthis our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us theland, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.2:15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for herhouse was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.2:16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest thepursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until thepursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.2:17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thineoath which thou hast made us swear.2:18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line ofscarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thoushalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thyfather's household, home unto thee.2:19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thyhouse into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we willbe guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his bloodshall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.2:20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit ofthine oath which thou hast made us to swear.2:21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sentthem away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in thewindow.2:22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there threedays, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought themthroughout all the way, but found them not.2:23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, andpassed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him allthings that befell them: 2:24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly theLORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all theinhabitants of the country do faint because of us.3:1 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed fromShittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, andlodged there before they passed over.3:2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers wentthrough the host; 3:3 And they commanded the people, saying, When yesee the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests theLevites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go afterit.3:4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousandcubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way bywhich ye must go: for ye have not passed this way heretofore.3:5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.3:6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of thecovenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark ofthe covenant, and went before the people.3:7 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnifythee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I waswith Moses, so I will be with thee.3:8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of thecovenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water ofJordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.3:9 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hearthe words of the LORD your God.3:10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God isamong you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you theCanaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, andthe Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.3:11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earthpasseth over before you into Jordan.3:12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,out of every tribe a man.3:13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet ofthe priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth,shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall becut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shallstand upon an heap.3:14 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, topass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenantbefore the people; 3:15 And as they that bare the ark were come untoJordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped inthe brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all thetime of harvest,) 3:16 That the waters which came down from abovestood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that isbeside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passedover right against Jericho.3:17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORDstood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all theIsraelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passedclean over Jordan.4:1 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed overJordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:2 Take you twelvemen out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 4:3 And command yethem, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of theplace where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shallcarry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, whereye shall lodge this night.4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of thechildren of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 4:5 And Joshua said untothem, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst ofJordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder,according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 4:6That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask theirfathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones?  4:7Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut offbefore the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed overJordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall befor a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.4:8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took uptwelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake untoJoshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children ofIsrael, and carried them over with them unto the place where theylodged, and laid them down there.4:9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in theplace where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenantstood: and they are there unto this day.4:10 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan,until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speakunto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and thepeople hasted and passed over.4:11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over,that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presenceof the people.4:12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half thetribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, asMoses spake unto them: 4:13 About forty thousand prepared for warpassed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.4:14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.4:15 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 4:16 Command the prieststhat bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.4:17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out ofJordan.4:18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of thecovenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and thesoles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that thewaters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all hisbanks, as they did before.4:19 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of thefirst month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.4:20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, didJoshua pitch in Gilgal.4:21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When yourchildren shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What meanthese stones?  4:22 Then ye shall let your children know, saying,Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from beforeyou, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Redsea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 4:24That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, thatit is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever.5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, whichwere on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of theCanaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried upthe waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we werepassed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in themany more, because of the children of Israel.5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children ofIsrael at the hill of the foreskins.5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the peoplethat came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, diedin the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all thepeople that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forthout of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt,were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: untowhom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which theLORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land thatfloweth with milk and honey.5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshuacircumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had notcircumcised them by the way.5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all thepeople, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they werewhole.5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away thereproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place iscalled Gilgal unto this day.5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept thepassover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains ofJericho.5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow afterthe passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of theold corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna anymore; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he liftedup his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over againsthim with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, andsaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?  5:14 And hesaid, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. AndJoshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said untohim, What saith my Lord unto his servant?  5:15 And the captain of theLORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; forthe place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children ofIsrael: none went out, and none came in.6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine handJericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go roundabout the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets oframs' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seventimes, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast withthe ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all thepeople shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shallfall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straightbefore him.6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seventrumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, andlet him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, thatthe seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed onbefore the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of thecovenant of the LORD followed them.6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with thetrumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on,and blowing with the trumpets.6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed outof your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up theark of the LORD.6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns beforethe ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets:and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after theark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returnedinto the camp: so they did six days.6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose earlyabout the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the samemanner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seventimes.6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blewwith the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORDhath given you the city.6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that aretherein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and allthat are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that wesent.6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lestye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, andmake the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, areconsecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of theLORD.6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell downflat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straightbefore him, and they took the city.6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man andwoman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of thesword.6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out thecountry, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman,and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab,and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that shehad; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without thecamp of Israel.6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: onlythe silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, theyput into the treasury of the house of the LORD.6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father'shousehold, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even untothis day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy outJericho.6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the manbefore the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: heshall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngestson shall he set up the gates of it.6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughoutall the country.7:1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursedthing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son ofZerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and theanger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.7:2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven,on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view thecountry.And the men went up and viewed Ai.7:3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all thepeople go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smiteAi; and make not all the people to labour thither; for they are butfew.7:4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men:and they fled before the men of Ai.7:5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for theychased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them inthe going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and becameas water.7:6 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his facebefore the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders ofIsrael, and put dust upon their heads.7:7 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at allbrought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of theAmorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelton the other side Jordan!  7:8 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israelturneth their backs before their enemies!  7:9 For the Canaanites andall the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ usround, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do untothy great name?  7:10 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up;wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?  7:11 Israel hath sinned, andthey have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: forthey have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, anddissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.7:12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before theirenemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because theywere accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroythe accursed from among you.7:13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursedthing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand beforethine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.7:14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to yourtribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh shallcome according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORDshall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORDshall take shall come man by man.7:15 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thingshall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hathtransgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wroughtfolly in Israel.7:16 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel bytheir tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 7:17 And he broughtthe family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and hebrought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:7:18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son ofCarmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, wastaken.7:19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory tothe LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me nowwhat thou hast done; hide it not from me.7:20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned againstthe LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 7:21 When I sawamong the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekelsof silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I covetedthem, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in themidst of my tent, and the silver under it.7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.7:23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought themunto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them outbefore the LORD.7:24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons,and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and histent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley ofAchor.7:25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shalltrouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, andburned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.7:26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. Sothe LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the nameof that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.8:1 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, Ihave given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,and his land: 8:2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didstunto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattlethereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambushfor the city behind it.8:3 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai:and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sentthem away by night.8:4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in waitagainst the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city,but be ye all ready: 8:5 And I, and all the people that are with me,will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they comeout against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 8:6(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from thecity; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first:therefore we will flee before them.8:7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city:for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.8:8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall setthe city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall yedo. See, I have commanded you.8:9 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush,and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshualodged that night among the people.8:10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people,and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.8:11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on thenorth side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.8:12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie inambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.8:13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was onthe north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of thecity, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.8:14 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hastedand rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel tobattle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind thecity.8:15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten beforethem, and fled by the way of the wilderness.8:16 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursueafter them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away fromthe city.8:17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not outafter Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.8:18 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is inthy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshuastretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.8:19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran assoon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city,and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.8:20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold,the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power toflee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wildernessturned back upon the pursuers.8:21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken thecity, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,and slew the men of Ai.8:22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they werein the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: andthey smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.8:23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.8:24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying allthe inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein theychased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword,until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai,and smote it with the edge of the sword.8:25 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men andwomen, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.8:26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out thespear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.8:27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a preyunto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which hecommanded Joshua.8:28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even adesolation unto this day.8:29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and assoon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take hiscarcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate ofthe city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remainethunto this day.8:30 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mountEbal, 8:31 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children ofIsrael, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar ofwhole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron: and theyoffered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peaceofferings.8:32 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.8:33 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests theLevites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well thestranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over againstmount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses theservant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless thepeople of Israel.8:34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings andcursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshuaread not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, andthe little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this sideJordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of thegreat sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, theCanaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof;9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua andwith Israel, with one accord.9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done untoJericho and to Ai, 9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as ifthey had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, andwine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 9:5 And old shoes andclouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the breadof their provision was dry and mouldy.9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said untohim, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: nowtherefore make ye a league with us.9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwellamong us; and how shall we make a league with you?  9:8 And they saidunto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who areye? and from whence come ye?  9:9 And they said unto him, From a veryfar country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thyGod: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that werebeyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan,which was at Ashtaroth.9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spaketo us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meetthem, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye aleague with us.9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses onthe day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, andit is mouldy: 9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, werenew; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoesare become old by reason of the very long journey.9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at themouth of the LORD.9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, tolet them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had madea league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours,and that they dwelt among them.9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their citieson the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, andBeeroth, and Kirjathjearim.9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes ofthe congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. Andall the congregation murmured against the princes.9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have swornunto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touchthem.9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrathbe upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them behewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as theprinces had promised them.9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; whenye dwell among us?  9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shallnone of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood anddrawers of water for the house of my God.9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly toldthy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses togive you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the landfrom before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because ofyou, and have done this thing.9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good andright unto thee to do unto us, do.9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand ofthe children of Israel, that they slew them not.9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of waterfor the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto thisday, in the place which he should choose.10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heardhow Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had doneto Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and howthe inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were amongthem; 10:2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, andall the men thereof were mighty.10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king ofHebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king ofLachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 10:4 Come up unto me,and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace withJoshua and with the children of Israel.10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the kingof Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and alltheir hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly,and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwellin the mountains are gathered together against us.10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warwith him, and all the mighty men of valour.10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I havedelivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them standbefore thee.10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgalall night.10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them witha great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goethup to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and werein the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stonesfrom heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more whichdied with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew withthe sword.10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD deliveredup the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in thesight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, inthe valley of Ajalon.10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the peoplehad avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in thebook of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, andhasted not to go down about a whole day.10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that theLORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought forIsrael.10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp toGilgal.10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave atMakkedah.10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid ina cave at Makkedah.10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,and set men by it for to keep them: 10:19 And stay ye not, but pursueafter your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not toenter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered theminto your hand.10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel hadmade an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till theywere consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered intofenced cities.10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah inpeace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring outthose five kings unto me out of the cave.10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him outof the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king ofJarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings untoJoshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said untothe captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, putyour feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and puttheir feet upon the necks of them.10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strongand of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemiesagainst whom ye fight.10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged themon five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and castthem into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones inthe cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge ofthe sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and allthe souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to theking of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, untoLibnah, and fought against Libnah: 10:30 And the LORD delivered italso, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote itwith the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; helet none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did untothe king of Jericho.10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, untoLachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:32 And theLORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on thesecond day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the soulsthat were therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshuasmote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel withhim; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 10:35 Andthey took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, andall the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day,according to all that he had done to Lachish.10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, untoHebron; and they fought against it: 10:37 And they took it, and smoteit with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all thecities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left noneremaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyedit utterly, and all the souls that were therein.10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; andfought against it: 10:39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and allthe cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword,and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left noneremaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to theking thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left noneremaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God ofIsrael commanded.10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and allthe country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp toGilgal.11:1 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard thosethings, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king ofShimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 11:2 And to the kings that wereon the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth,and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 11:3 And tothe Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the Amorite, and theHittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and tothe Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.11:4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, muchpeople, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, withhorses and chariots very many.11:5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitchedtogether at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.11:6 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: forto morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain beforeIsrael: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots withfire.11:7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against themby the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.11:8 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smotethem, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, andunto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until theyleft them none remaining.11:9 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed theirhorses, and burnt their chariots with fire.11:10 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smotethe king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head ofall those kingdoms.11:11 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge ofthe sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe:and he burnt Hazor with fire.11:12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and heutterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded.11:13 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israelburned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.11:14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the childrenof Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smotewith the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neitherleft they any to breathe.11:15 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses commandJoshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORDcommanded Moses.11:16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the southcountry, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain,and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 11:17 Evenfrom the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in thevalley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, andsmote them, and slew them.11:18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.11:19 There was not a city that made peace with the children ofIsrael, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other theytook in battle.11:20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they shouldcome against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, andthat they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as theLORD commanded Moses.11:21 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from themountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all themountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshuadestroyed them utterly with their cities.11:22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the childrenof Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.11:23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORDsaid unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israelaccording to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested fromwar.12:1 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of Israelsmote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward therising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all theplain on the east: 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt inHeshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the riverArnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, evenunto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;12:3 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and untothe sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the way toBethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: 12:4 And thecoast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant of the giants,that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 12:5 And reigned in mountHermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of theGeshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihonking of Heshbon.12:6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israelsmite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession untothe Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.12:7 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and thechildren of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgadin the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up toSeir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possessionaccording to their divisions; 12:8 In the mountains, and in thevalleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness,and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and theCanaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 12:9 Theking of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;12:10 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 12:11 Theking of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12:12 The king ofEglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 12:13 The king of Debir, one; theking of Geder, one; 12:14 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad,one; 12:15 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 12:16The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 12:17 The king ofTappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 12:18 The king of Aphek, one;the king of Lasharon, one; 12:19 The king of Madon, one; the king ofHazor, one; 12:20 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph,one; 12:21 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 12:22The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one; 12:23 Theking of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations ofGilgal, one; 12:24 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty andone.13:1 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said untohim, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet verymuch land to be possessed.
