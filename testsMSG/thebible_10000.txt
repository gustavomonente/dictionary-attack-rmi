And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of thewaters.1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the lightfrom the darkness.1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.And the evening and the morning were the first day.1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,and let it divide the waters from the waters.1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which wereunder the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:and it was so.1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and themorning were the second day.1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered togetherunto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together ofthe waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yieldingseed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed isin itself, upon the earth: and it was so.1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed afterhis kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, afterhis kind: and God saw that it was good.1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavento divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and forseasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights inthe firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it wasso.1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give lightupon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, andto divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the movingcreature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in theopen firmament of heaven.1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature thatmoveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fillthe waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature afterhis kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after hiskind: and it was so.1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattleafter their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth afterhis kind: and God saw that it was good.1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowlof the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and overevery creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God createdhe him; male and female created he them.1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, andmultiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominionover the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over everyliving thing that moveth upon the earth.1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the whichis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there islife, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it wasvery good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host ofthem.2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; andhe rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because thatin it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth whenthey were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and theheavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had notcaused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till theground.2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the wholeface of the ground.2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a livingsoul.2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there heput the man whom he had formed.2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that ispleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in themidst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thenceit was parted, and became into four heads.2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth thewhole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of thatland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it thatcompasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it whichgoeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden ofEden to dress it and to keep it.2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of thegarden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledgeof good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thoueatest thereof thou shalt surely die.2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should bealone; I will make him an help meet for him.2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of thefield, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to seewhat he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every livingcreature, that was the name thereof.2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found anhelp meet for him.2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and heslept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh insteadthereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, madehe a woman, and brought her unto the man.2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of myflesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shallcleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were notashamed.3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field whichthe LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman saidunto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lestye die.3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shallbe opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and thatit was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make onewise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also untoher husband with her; and he did eat.3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that theywere naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselvesaprons.3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden inthe cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from thepresence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where artthou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I wasafraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, shegave me of the tree, and I did eat.3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hastdone? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast donethis, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of thefield; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all thedays of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and thewoman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,and thou shalt bruise his heel.3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow andthy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thydesire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voiceof thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thornsalso and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat theherb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: fordust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the motherof all living.3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats ofskins, and clothed them.3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, toknow good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take alsoof the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore theLORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the groundfrom whence he was taken.3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the gardenof Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keepthe way of the tree of life.4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, andsaid, I have gotten a man from the LORD.4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper ofsheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of thefruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and ofthe fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to hisoffering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thycountenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not beaccepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And untothee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, whenthey were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,and slew him.4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And hesaid, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, Whathast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me fromthe ground.4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened hermouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thoutillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee herstrength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.4:13 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I canbear.4:14 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of theearth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive anda vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every onethat findeth me shall slay me.4:15 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a markupon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.4:16 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in theland of Nod, on the east of Eden.4:17 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and hebuilded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of hisson, Enoch.4:18 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: andMehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.4:19 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,and the name of the other Zillah.4:20 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,and of such as have cattle.4:21 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all suchas handle the harp and organ.4:22 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of everyartificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.4:23 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice;ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man tomy wounding, and a young man to my hurt.4:24 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy andsevenfold.4:25 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called hisname Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed insteadof Abel, whom Cain slew.4:26 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called hisname Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.5:1 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that Godcreated man, in the likeness of God made he him; 5:2 Male and femalecreated he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in theday when they were created.5:3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in hisown likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth: 5:4 Andthe days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years:and he begat sons and daughters: 5:5 And all the days that Adam livedwere nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.5:6 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 5:7 AndSeth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, andbegat sons and daughters: 5:8 And all the days of Seth were ninehundred and twelve years: and he died.5:9 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 5:10 And Enos livedafter he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sonsand daughters: 5:11 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred andfive years: and he died.5:12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel: 5:13 AndCainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years,and begat sons and daughters: 5:14 And all the days of Cainan werenine hundred and ten years: and he died.5:15 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 5:16And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirtyyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:17 And all the days ofMahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.5:18 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begatEnoch: 5:19 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,and begat sons and daughters: 5:20 And all the days of Jared were ninehundred sixty and two years: and he died.5:21 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 5:22And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundredyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:23 And all the days of Enochwere three hundred sixty and five years: 5:24 And Enoch walked withGod: and he was not; for God took him.5:25 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begatLamech.5:26 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eightyand two years, and begat sons and daughters: 5:27 And all the days ofMethuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.5:28 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat ason: 5:29 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfortus concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the groundwhich the LORD hath cursed.5:30 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and fiveyears, and begat sons and daughters: 5:31 And all the days of Lamechwere seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.5:32 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,and Japheth.6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of theearth, and daughters were born unto them, 6:2 That the sons of God sawthe daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives ofall which they chose.6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, forthat he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twentyyears.6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they barechildren to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men ofrenown.6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, andthat every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evilcontinually.6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and itgrieved him at his heart.6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from theface of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, andthe fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.6:9 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfectin his generations, and Noah walked with God.6:10 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.6:11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filledwith violence.6:12 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; forall flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.6:13 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me;for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, Iwill destroy them with the earth.6:14 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in theark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.6:15 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The lengthof the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fiftycubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.6:16 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thoufinish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the sidethereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.6:17 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon theearth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from underheaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.6:18 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt comeinto the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wiveswith thee.6:19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shaltthou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall bemale and female.6:20 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, ofevery creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sortshall come unto thee, to keep them alive.6:21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shaltgather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.6:22 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so didhe.7:1 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into theark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.7:2 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the maleand his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male andhis female.7:3 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; tokeep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.7:4 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earthforty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I havemade will I destroy from off the face of the earth.7:5 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.7:6 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters wasupon the earth.7:7 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wiveswith him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.7:8 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls,and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 7:9 There went in twoand two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God hadcommanded Noah.7:10 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of theflood were upon the earth.7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountainsof the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.7:12 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.7:13 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sonswith them, into the ark; 7:14 They, and every beast after his kind,and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing thatcreepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind,every bird of every sort.7:15 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of allflesh, wherein is the breath of life.7:16 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, asGod had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.7:17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the watersincreased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.7:18 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon theearth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.7:19 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all thehigh hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.7:20 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountainswere covered.7:21 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, andof cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth, and every man: 7:22 All in whose nostrils was thebreath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.7:23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the faceof the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and thefowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noahonly remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.7:24 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fiftydays.8:1 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all thecattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass overthe earth, and the waters asswaged; 8:2 The fountains also of the deepand the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven wasrestrained; 8:3 And the waters returned from off the earthcontinually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days thewaters were abated.8:4 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day ofthe month, upon the mountains of Ararat.8:5 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in thetenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of themountains seen.8:6 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened thewindow of the ark which he had made: 8:7 And he sent forth a raven,which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from offthe earth.8:8 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters wereabated from off the face of the ground; 8:9 But the dove found no restfor the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, forthe waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth hishand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.8:10 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth thedove out of the ark; 8:11 And the dove came in to him in the evening;and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew thatthe waters were abated from off the earth.8:12 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;which returned not again unto him any more.8:13 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in thefirst month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up fromoff the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.8:14 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of themonth, was the earth dried.8:15 And God spake unto Noah, saying, 8:16 Go forth of the ark, thou,and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.8:17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, ofall flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in theearth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.8:18 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'wives with him: 8:19 Every beast, every creeping thing, and everyfowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, wentforth out of the ark.8:20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every cleanbeast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on thealtar.8:21 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in hisheart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; forthe imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will Iagain smite any more every thing living, as I have done.8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold andheat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.9:1 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Befruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beastof the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that movethupon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand arethey delivered.9:3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as thegreen herb have I given you all things.9:4 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shallye not eat.9:5 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand ofevery beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand ofevery man's brother will I require the life of man.9:6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for inthe image of God made he man.9:7 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly inthe earth, and multiply therein.9:8 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9:9 AndI, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed afteryou; 9:10 And with every living creature that is with you, of thefowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; fromall that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.9:11 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall allflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shallthere any more be a flood to destroy the earth.9:12 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I makebetween me and you and every living creature that is with you, forperpetual generations: 9:13 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shallbe for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.9:14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth,that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: 9:15 And I will remember mycovenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of allflesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy allflesh.9:16 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, thatI may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every livingcreature of all flesh that is upon the earth.9:17 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, whichI have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.9:18 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, andHam, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.9:19 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earthoverspread.9:20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:9:21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncoveredwithin his tent.9:22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,and told his two brethren without.9:23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both theirshoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of theirfather; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father'snakedness.9:24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son haddone unto him.9:25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he beunto his brethren.9:26 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall behis servant.9:27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents ofShem; and Canaan shall be his servant.9:28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.9:29 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: andhe died.10:1 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, andJapheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.10:2 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, andTubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.10:3 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.10:4 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, andDodanim.10:5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands;every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.10:6 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.10:7 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah,and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.10:8 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.10:10 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, andAccad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.10:11 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and thecity Rehoboth, and Calah, 10:12 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah:the same is a great city.10:13 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,10:14 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) andCaphtorim.10:15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 10:16 And theJebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 10:17 And the Hivite,and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 10:18 And the Arvadite, and theZemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of theCanaanites spread abroad.10:19 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comestto Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, andAdmah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.10:20 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after theirtongues, in their countries, and in their nations.10:21 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, thebrother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.10:22 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,and Aram.10:23 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.10:24 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.10:25 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; forin his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.10:26 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, andJerah, 10:27 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 10:28 And Obal, andAbimael, and Sheba, 10:29 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all thesewere the sons of Joktan.10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar amount of the east.10:31 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after theirtongues, in their lands, after their nations.10:32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after theirgenerations, in their nations: and by these were the nations dividedin the earth after the flood.11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that theyfound a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burnthem thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they formorter.11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whosetop may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we bescattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which thechildren of men builded.11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have allone language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will berestrained from them, which they have imagined to do.11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, thatthey may not understand one another's speech.11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face ofall the earth: and they left off to build the city.11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD didthere confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did theLORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred yearsold, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11:11 And Shemlived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons anddaughters.11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 11:13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years,and begat sons and daughters.11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 11:15 And Salahlived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sonsand daughters.11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 11:17 AndEber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, andbegat sons and daughters.11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 11:19 And Peleglived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sonsand daughters.11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 11:21 AndReu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begatsons and daughters.11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 11:23 And Seruglived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons anddaughters.11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 11:25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,and begat sons and daughters.11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, andHaran.11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of hisnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wifewas Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter ofHaran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son'sson, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and theywent forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land ofCanaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terahdied in Haran.12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that Iwill shew thee: 12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and Iwill bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be ablessing: 12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse himthat curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth beblessed.12:4 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot wentwith him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departedout of Haran.12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and alltheir substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they hadgotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan;and into the land of Canaan they came.12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, untothe plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will Igive this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, whoappeared unto him.12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel,and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east:and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the nameof the LORD.12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down intoEgypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art afair woman to look upon: 12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, whenthe Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife:and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well withme for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, theEgyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her beforePharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, andoxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,and camels.12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plaguesbecause of Sarai Abram's wife.12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hastdone unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?  12:19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me towife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent himaway, and his wife, and all that he had.13:1 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that hehad, and Lot with him, into the south.13:2 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.13:3 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, untothe place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel andHai; 13:4 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at thefirst: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.13:5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, andtents.13:6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwelltogether: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwelltogether.13:7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle andthe herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzitedwelled then in the land.13:8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we bebrethren.13:9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.13:10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan,that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodomand Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,as thou comest unto Zoar.13:11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyedeast: and they separated themselves the one from the other.13:12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in thecities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.13:13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORDexceedingly.13:14 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated fromhim, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou artnorthward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 13:15 For allthe land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.13:16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if aman can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also benumbered.13:17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in thebreadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.13:18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain ofMamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD.14:1 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king ofnations; 14:2 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and withBirsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king ofZeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.14:3 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which isthe salt sea.14:4 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth yearthey rebelled.14:5 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings thatwere with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and theZuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 14:6 And theHorites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.14:7 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, andsmote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, thatdwelt in Hazezontamar.14:8 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah,and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela(the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale ofSiddim; 14:9 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal kingof nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;four kings with five.14:10 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings ofSodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fledto the mountain.14:11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all theirvictuals, and went their way.14:12 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,and his goods, and departed.14:13 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew;for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, andbrother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.14:14 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, hearmed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred andeighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.14:15 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, bynight, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on theleft hand of Damascus.14:16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again hisbrother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.14:17 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return fromthe slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, atthe valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.14:18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: andhe was the priest of the most high God.14:19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most highGod, possessor of heaven and earth: 14:20 And blessed be the most highGod, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave himtithes of all.14:21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, andtake the goods to thyself.14:22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine handunto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,14:23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, andthat I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say,I have made Abram rich: 14:24 Save only that which the young men haveeaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol,and Mamre; let them take their portion.15:1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in avision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceedinggreat reward.15:2 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I gochildless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?15:3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo,one born in my house is mine heir.15:4 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, Thisshall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine ownbowels shall be thine heir.15:5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towardheaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and hesaid unto him, So shall thy seed be.15:6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him forrighteousness.15:7 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Urof the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.15:8 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inheritit?  15:9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and aturtledove, and a young pigeon.15:10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.15:11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove themaway.15:12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.15:13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall bea stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve them; andthey shall afflict them four hundred years; 15:14 And also thatnation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall theycome out with great substance.15:15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buriedin a good old age.15:16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: forthe iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.15:17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it wasdark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed betweenthose pieces.15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto thegreat river, the river Euphrates: 15:19 The Kenites, and theKenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 15:20 And the Hittites, and thePerizzites, and the Rephaims, 15:21 And the Amorites, and theCanaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.16:1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had anhandmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.16:2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrainedme from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I mayobtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.16:3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, afterAbram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to herhusband Abram to be his wife.16:4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she sawthat she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.16:5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given mymaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I wasdespised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee.16:6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; doto her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, shefled from her face.16:7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in thewilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.16:8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whitherwilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.16:9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress,and submit thyself under her hands.16:10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thyseed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.16:11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art withchild and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; becausethe LORD hath heard thy affliction.16:12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presenceof all his brethren.16:13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, ThouGod seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him thatseeth me?  16:14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold,it is between Kadesh and Bered.16:15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,which Hagar bare, Ishmael.16:16 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bareIshmael to Abram.17:1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appearedto Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me,and be thou perfect.17:2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and willmultiply thee exceedingly.17:3 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 17:4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be afather of many nations.17:5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy nameshall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nationsof thee, and kings shall come out of thee.17:7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seedafter thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be aGod unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.17:8 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the landwherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for aneverlasting possession; and I will be their God.17:9 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.17:10 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you andthy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.17:11 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shallbe a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.17:12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, orbought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.17:13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thymoney, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in yourflesh for an everlasting covenant.17:14 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin isnot circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hathbroken my covenant.17:15 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt notcall her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.17:16 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, Iwill bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peopleshall be of her.17:17 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in hisheart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old?and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  17:18 And Abrahamsaid unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!  17:19 And Godsaid, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt callhis name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for aneverlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessedhim, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly;twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.17:21 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shallbear unto thee at this set time in the next year.17:22 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.17:23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in hishouse, and all that were bought with his money, every male among themen of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin inthe selfsame day, as God had said unto him.17:24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.17:25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he wascircumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.17:26 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael hisson.17:27 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought withmoney of the stranger, were circumcised with him.18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he satin the tent door in the heat of the day; 18:2 And he lift up his eyesand looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, heran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward theground, 18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thysight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 18:4 Let a littlewater, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselvesunder the tree: 18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfortye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye cometo your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Makeready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakesupon the hearth.18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good,and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and theydid eat.18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,Behold, in the tent.18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to thetime of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarahheard it in the tent door, which was behind him.18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and itceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxedold shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?  18:13 And the LORDsaid unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of asurety bear a child, which am old?  18:14 Is any thing too hard forthe LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according tothe time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: andAbraham went with them to bring them on the way.18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which Ido; 18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mightynation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and hishousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to dojustice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that whichhe hath spoken of him.18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah isgreat, and because their sin is very grievous; 18:21 I will go downnow, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry ofit, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towardSodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy therighteous with the wicked?  18:24 Peradventure there be fiftyrighteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare theplace for the fifty righteous that are therein?  18:25 That be farfrom thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with thewicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be farfrom thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  18:26 Andthe LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,then I will spare all the place for their sakes.18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon meto speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 18:28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thoudestroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find thereforty and five, I will not destroy it.18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure thereshall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty'ssake.18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I willspeak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, Iwill not do it, if I find thirty there.18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, Iwill not destroy it for twenty's sake.18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yetbut this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, Iwill not destroy it for ten's sake.18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing withAbraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.19:1 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in thegate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowedhimself with his face toward the ground; 19:2 And he said, Behold now,my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarryall night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go onyour ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street allnight.19:3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bakeunleavened bread, and they did eat.19:4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men ofSodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the peoplefrom every quarter: 19:5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him,Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them outunto us, that we may know them.19:6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door afterhim, 19:7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.19:8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; letme, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is goodin your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came theyunder the shadow of my roof.19:9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellowcame in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we dealworse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man,even Lot, and came near to break the door.19:10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the houseto them, and shut to the door.19:11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house withblindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves tofind the door.19:12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son inlaw, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in thecity, bring them out of this place: 19:13 For we will destroy thisplace, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of theLORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.19:14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which marriedhis daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORDwill destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sonsin law.19:15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.19:16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and uponthe hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORDbeing merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set himwithout the city.19:17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither staythou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.19:18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 19:19 Behold now,thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thymercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannotescape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 19:20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shalllive.19:21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning thisthing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thouhast spoken.19:22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thoube come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.19:23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.19:24 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone andfire from the LORD out of heaven; 19:25 And he overthrew those cities,and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and thatwhich grew upon the ground.19:26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became apillar of salt.19:27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where hestood before the LORD: 19:28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah,and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smokeof the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.19:29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of theoverthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.19:30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and histwo daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dweltin a cave, he and his two daughters.19:31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, andthere is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner ofall the earth: 19:32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and wewill lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.19:33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and thefirstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not whenshe lay down, nor when she arose.19:34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said untothe younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make himdrink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that wemay preserve seed of our father.19:35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and theyounger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she laydown, nor when she arose.19:36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.19:37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: thesame is the father of the Moabites unto this day.19:38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his nameBenammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto thisday.20:1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, anddwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.20:2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: andAbimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;for she is a man's wife.20:4 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thouslay also a righteous nation?  20:5 Said he not unto me, She is mysister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in theintegrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.20:6 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didstthis in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee fromsinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.20:7 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, andhe shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore hernot, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that arethine.20:8 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all hisservants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men weresore afraid.20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thoudone unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought onme and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me thatought not to be done.20:10 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thouhast done this thing?  20:11 And Abraham said, Because I thought,Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me formy wife's sake.20:12 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of myfather, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.20:13 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from myfather's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thoushalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me,He is my brother.20:14 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, andwomenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah hiswife.20:15 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell whereit pleaseth thee.20:16 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother athousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of theeyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she wasreproved.20:17 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and hiswife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.20:18 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house ofAbimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.21:1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did untoSarah as he had spoken.21:2 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, atthe set time of which God had spoken to him.21:3 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.21:4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, asGod had commanded him.21:5 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was bornunto him.21:6 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hearwill laugh with me.21:7 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah shouldhave given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.21:8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a greatfeast the same day that Isaac was weaned.21:9 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had bornunto Abraham, mocking.21:10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and herson: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, evenwith Isaac.21:11 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because ofhis son.21:12 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sightbecause of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarahhath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thyseed be called.21:13 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,because he is thy seed.21:14 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and abottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered inthe wilderness of Beersheba.21:15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the childunder one of the shrubs.21:16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off,as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the death of thechild. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.21:17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God calledto Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar?fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I willmake him a great nation.21:19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and shewent, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.21:20 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in thewilderness, and became an archer.21:21 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took hima wife out of the land of Egypt.21:22 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol thechief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with theein all that thou doest: 21:23 Now therefore swear unto me here by Godthat thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with myson's son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee,thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.21:24 And Abraham said, I will swear.21:25 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, whichAbimelech's servants had violently taken away.21:26 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neitherdidst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.21:27 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;and both of them made a covenant.21:28 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.21:29 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambswhich thou hast set by themselves?  21:30 And he said, For these sevenewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness untome, that I have digged this well.21:31 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there theysware both of them.21:32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up,and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into theland of the Philistines.21:33 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there onthe name of the LORD, the everlasting God.21:34 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.22:1 And it came to pass after these things, that God did temptAbraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.22:2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thoulovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there fora burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.22:3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clavethe wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the placeof which God had told him.22:4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw theplace afar off.22:5 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass;and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.22:6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it uponIsaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and theywent both of them together.22:7 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: andhe said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood:but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?  22:8 And Abraham said, Myson, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so theywent both of them together.22:9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abrahambuilt an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac hisson, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.22:10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slayhis son.22:11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, andsaid, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.22:12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thouany thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thouhast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.22:13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behindhim a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and tookthe ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of hisson.22:14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it issaid to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.22:15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven thesecond time, 22:16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD,for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,thine only son: 22:17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and inmultiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, andas the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possessthe gate of his enemies; 22:18 And in thy seed shall all the nationsof the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.22:19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up andwent together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.22:20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was toldAbraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thybrother Nahor; 22:21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, andKemuel the father of Aram, 22:22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash,and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.22:23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,Abraham's brother.22:24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.23:1 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: thesewere the years of the life of Sarah.23:2 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land ofCanaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.23:3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto thesons of Heth, saying, 23:4 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you:give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury mydead out of my sight.23:5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:6Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice ofour sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee hissepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.23:7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of theland, even to the children of Heth.23:8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that Ishould bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me toEphron the son of Zohar, 23:9 That he may give me the cave ofMachpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for asmuch money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of aburyingplace amongst you.23:10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron theHittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, evenof all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 23:11 Nay, mylord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, Igive it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee:bury thy dead.23:12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.23:13 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of theland, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I willgive thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my deadthere.23:14 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 23:15 My lord,hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver;what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.23:16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephronthe silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth,four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.23:17 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was beforeMamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the treesthat were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, weremade sure 23:18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of thechildren of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.23:19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of thefield of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land ofCanaan.23:20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure untoAbraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.24:1 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD hadblessed Abraham in all things.24:2 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruledover all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 24:3And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the Godof the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of thedaughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 24:4 But thou shaltgo unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my sonIsaac.24:5 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not bewilling to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son againunto the land from whence thou camest?  24:6 And Abraham said untohim, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.24:7 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, andfrom the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that swareunto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall sendhis angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son fromthence.24:8 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thoushalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.24:9 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham hismaster, and sware to him concerning that matter.24:10 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, anddeparted; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and hearose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.24:11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a wellof water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go outto draw water.24:12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, sendme good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.24:13 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters ofthe men of the city come out to draw water: 24:14 And let it come topass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, Ipray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will givethy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointedfor thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewedkindness unto my master.24:15 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife ofNahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.24:16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither hadany man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled herpitcher, and came up.24:17 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,drink a little water of thy pitcher.24:18 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down herpitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.24:19 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will drawwater for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.24:20 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ranagain unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.24:21 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether theLORD had made his journey prosperous or not.24:22 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that theman took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two braceletsfor her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 24:23 And said, Whosedaughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father'shouse for us to lodge in?  24:24 And she said unto him, I am thedaughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.24:25 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provenderenough, and room to lodge in.24:26 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.24:27 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, whohath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I beingin the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.24:28 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house thesethings.24:29 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ranout unto the man, unto the well.24:30 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets uponhis sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,behold, he stood by the camels at the well.24:31 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; whereforestandest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for thecamels.24:32 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, andgave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,and the men's feet that were with him.24:33 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I willnot eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.24:34 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.24:35 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is becomegreat: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold,and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.24:36 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she wasold: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.24:37 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wifeto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:24:38 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, andtake a wife unto my son.24:39 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will notfollow me.24:40 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send hisangel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife formy son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 24:41 Then shalt thoube clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and ifthey give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath.24:42 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of mymaster Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 24:43Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, thatwhen the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me,I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 24:44 And she sayto me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let thesame be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master'sson.24:45 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekahcame forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down untothe well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I praythee.24:46 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank,and she made the camels drink also.24:47 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And shesaid, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him:and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.24:48 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessedthe LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right wayto take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.24:49 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tellme: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to theleft.24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedethfrom the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.24:51 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her bethy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.24:52 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard theirwords, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.24:53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels ofgold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to herbrother and to her mother precious things.24:54 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said,Send me away unto my master.24:55 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide withus a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.24:56 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hathprospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.24:57 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at hermouth.24:58 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go withthis man? And she said, I will go.24:59 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, andAbraham's servant, and his men.24:60 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art oursister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seedpossess the gate of those which hate them.24:61 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon thecamels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and wenthis way.24:62 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dweltin the south country.24:63 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: andhe lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.24:64 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, shelighted off the camel.24:65 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walkethin the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.24:66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.24:67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and tookRebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac wascomforted after his mother's death.25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, andIshbak, and Shuah.25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan wereAsshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah,and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abrahamgave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,eastward, unto the east country.25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which helived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, anold man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave ofMachpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, whichis before Mamre; 25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sonsof Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessedhis son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whomHagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 25:13 Andthese are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, accordingto their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar,and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 25:15Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 25:16 These are the sonsof Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by theircastles; twelve princes according to their nations.25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred andthirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and wasgathered unto his people.25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, asthou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all hisbrethren.25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abrahambegat Isaac: 25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekahto wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sisterto Laban the Syrian.25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she wasbarren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wifeconceived.25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, Ifit be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and twomanner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the onepeople shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shallserve the younger.25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, therewere twins in her womb.25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; andthey called his name Esau.25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold onEsau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescoreyears old when she bare them.25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of thefield; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: butRebekah loved Jacob.25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he wasfaint: 25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with thatsame red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profitshall this birthright do to me?  25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to methis day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright untoJacob.25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he dideat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised hisbirthright.26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine thatwas in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of thePhilistines unto Gerar.26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 26:3 Sojourn in thisland, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, andunto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform theoath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 26:4 And I will make thyseed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seedall these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of theearth be blessed; 26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and keptmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 26:7 And the men of the place asked himof his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, Sheis my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me forRebekah; because she was fair to look upon.26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, thatAbimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she isthy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said untohim, Because I said, Lest I die for her.26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one ofthe people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldesthave brought guiltiness upon us.26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheththis man or his wife shall surely be put to death.26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year anhundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until hebecame very great: 26:14 For he had possession of flocks, andpossession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistinesenvied him.26:15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in thedays of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, andfilled them with earth.26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art muchmightier than we.26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley ofGerar, and dwelt there.26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had diggedin the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stoppedthem after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after thenames by which his father had called them.26:19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there awell of springing water.26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;because they strove with him.26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and hecalled the name of it Sitnah.26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and forthat they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and hesaid, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitfulin the land.26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I amthe God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and willbless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of theLORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged awell.26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of hisfriends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing yehate me, and have sent me away from you?  26:28 And they said, We sawcertainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be nowan oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make acovenant with thee; 26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have nottouched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and havesent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one toanother: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him inpeace.26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said untohim, We have found water.26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city isBeersheba unto this day.26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith thedaughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon theHittite: 26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.27:1 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes weredim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and saidunto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.27:2 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of mydeath: 27:3 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiverand thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 27:4And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that Imay eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.27:5 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau wentto the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.27:6 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thyfather speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 27:7 Bring me venison, andmake me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORDbefore my death.27:8 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which Icommand thee.27:9 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids ofthe goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such ashe loveth: 27:10 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he mayeat, and that he may bless thee before his death.27:11 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother isa hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 27:12 My father peradventure willfeel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring acurse upon me, and not a blessing.27:13 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: onlyobey my voice, and go fetch me them.27:14 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: andhis mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.27:15 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, whichwere with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:27:16 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,and upon the smooth of his neck: 27:17 And she gave the savoury meatand the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.27:18 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,Here am I; who art thou, my son?  27:19 And Jacob said unto hisfather, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badestme: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul maybless me.27:20 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found itso quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought itto me.27:21 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I mayfeel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.27:22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, andsaid, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.27:23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as hisbrother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.27:24 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.27:25 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son'svenison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him,and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.27:26 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me,my son.27:27 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell ofhis raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is asthe smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 27:28 Therefore Godgive thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, andplenty of corn and wine: 27:29 Let people serve thee, and nations bowdown to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bowdown to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be hethat blesseth thee.27:30 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end ofblessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence ofIsaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.27:31 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto hisfather, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of hisson's venison, that thy soul may bless me.27:32 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, Iam thy son, thy firstborn Esau.27:33 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is hethat hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of allbefore thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall beblessed.27:34 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with agreat and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me,even me also, O my father.27:35 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken awaythy blessing.27:36 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hathsupplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and,behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou notreserved a blessing for me?  27:37 And Isaac answered and said untoEsau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have Igiven to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustainedhim: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?  27:38 And Esau saidunto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, evenme also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.27:39 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thydwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heavenfrom above; 27:40 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt servethy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have thedominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.27:41 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith hisfather blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourningfor my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.27:42 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: andshe sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold,thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing tokill thee.27:43 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Labanmy brother to Haran; 27:44 And tarry with him a few days, until thybrother's fury turn away; 27:45 Until thy brother's anger turn awayfrom thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I willsend, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of youboth in one day?  27:46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of mylife because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of thedaughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of theland, what good shall my life do me?  28:1 And Isaac called Jacob, andblessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take awife of the daughters of Canaan.28:2 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother'sfather; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thymother's brother.28:3 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiplythee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 28:4 And give theethe blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thoumayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gaveunto Abraham.28:5 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban,son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau'smother.28:6 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away toPadanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed himhe gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of thedaughers of Canaan; 28:7 And that Jacob obeyed his father and hismother, and was gone to Padanaram; 28:8 And Esau seeing that thedaughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 28:9 Then went Esauunto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath thedaughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be hiswife.28:10 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.28:11 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there allnight, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of thatplace, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place tosleep.28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and thetop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascendingand descending on it.28:13 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORDGod of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thouliest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 28:14 And thy seedshall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to thewest, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in theeand in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.28:15 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all placeswhither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for Iwill not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken tothee of.28:16 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORDis in this place; and I knew it not.28:17 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this isnone other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.28:18 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone thathe had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oilupon the top of it.28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name ofthat city was called Luz at the first.28:20 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and willkeep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, andraiment to put on, 28:21 So that I come again to my father's house inpeace; then shall the LORD be my God: 28:22 And this stone, which Ihave set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thoushalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of thepeople of the east.29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, therewere three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well theywatered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled thestone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stoneagain upon the well's mouth in his place.29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And theysaid, Of Haran are we.29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And theysaid, We know him.29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that thecattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go andfeed them.29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gatheredtogether, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then wewater the sheep.29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father'ssheep; for she kept them.29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Labanhis mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother,that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, andwatered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and thathe was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob hissister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissedhim, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. Andhe abode with him the space of a month.29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thywages be?  29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elderwas Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and wellfavoured.29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven yearsfor Rachel thy younger daughter.29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than thatI should give her to another man: abide with me.29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed untohim but a few days, for the love he had to her.29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days arefulfilled, that I may go in unto her.29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made afeast.29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah hisdaughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for anhandmaid.29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not Iserve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to givethe younger before the firstborn.29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the servicewhich thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachelhis daughter to wife also.29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to beher maid.29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel morethan Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:but Rachel was barren.29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his nameReuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;now therefore my husband will love me.29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because theLORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:and she called his name Simeon.29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this timewill my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:therefore was his name called Levi.29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now willI praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and leftbearing.30:1 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachelenvied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else Idie.30:2 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am Iin God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?30:3 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and sheshall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.30:4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went inunto her.30:5 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.30:6 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard myvoice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.30:7 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a secondson.30:8 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with mysister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.30:9 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah hermaid, and gave her Jacob to wife.30:10 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.30:11 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.30:12 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.30:13 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call meblessed: and she called his name Asher.30:14 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and foundmandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. ThenRachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.30:15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast takenmy husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? AndRachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son'smandrakes.30:16 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah wentout to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely Ihave hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her thatnight.30:17 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacobthe fifth son.30:18 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have givenmy maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.30:19 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.30:20 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will myhusband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and shecalled his name Zebulun.30:21 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.30:22 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and openedher womb.30:23 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken awaymy reproach: 30:24 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORDshall add to me another son.30:25 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacobsaid unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, andto my country.30:26 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.30:27 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour inthine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hathblessed me for thy sake.30:28 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.30:29 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, andhow thy cattle was with me.30:30 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is nowincreased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since mycoming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?  30:31And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt notgive me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will againfeed and keep thy flock.30:32 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thenceall the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle amongthe sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of suchshall be my hire.30:33 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when itshall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckledand spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall becounted stolen with me.30:34 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thyword.30:35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked andspotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, andevery one that had some white in it, and all the brown among thesheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.30:36 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: andJacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.30:37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel andchesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the whiteappear which was in the rods.30:38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in thegutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, thatthey should conceive when they came to drink.30:39 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forthcattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.30:40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of theflocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock ofLaban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not untoLaban's cattle.30:41 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle didconceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle inthe gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.30:42 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so thefeebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.30:43 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, andmaidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.31:1 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath takenaway all that was our father's; and of that which was our father'shath he gotten all this glory.31:2 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it wasnot toward him as before.31:3 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thyfathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.31:4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto hisflock, 31:5 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, thatit is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been withme.31:6 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.31:7 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times;but God suffered him not to hurt me.31:8 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all thecattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall bethy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.31:9 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and giventhem to me.31:10 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, thatI lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams whichleaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.31:11 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:And I said, Here am I.31:12 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams whichleap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for Ihave seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, andwhere thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from thisland, and return unto the land of thy kindred.31:14 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet anyportion or inheritance for us in our father's house?  31:15 Are we notcounted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devouredalso our money.31:16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that isours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said untothee, do.31:17 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;31:18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which hehad gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten inPadanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.31:19 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen theimages that were her father's.31:20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that hetold him not that he fled.31:21 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed overthe river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.31:22 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.31:23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him sevendays' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.31:24 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and saidunto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.31:25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in themount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.31:26 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou haststolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captivestaken with the sword?  31:27 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly,and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sentthee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?31:28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thouhast now done foolishly in so doing.31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God ofyour father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed thatthou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.31:30 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sorelongedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen mygods?  31:31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I wasafraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thydaughters from me.31:32 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: beforeour brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.31:33 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and intothe two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he outof Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.31:34 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel'sfurniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, butfound them not.31:35 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that Icannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And hesearched but found not the images.31:36 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answeredand said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hastso hotly pursued after me?  31:37 Whereas thou hast searched all mystuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it herebefore my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt usboth.31:38 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy shegoats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I noteaten.31:39 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I barethe loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen byday, or stolen by night.31:40 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost bynight; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.31:41 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served theefourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle:and thou hast changed my wages ten times.31:42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear ofIsaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. Godhath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked theeyesternight.31:43 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are mydaughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are mycattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this dayunto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born?31:44 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; andlet it be for a witness between me and thee.31:45 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.31:46 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they tookstones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.31:47 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.31:48 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee thisday.Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 31:49 And Mizpah; for hesaid, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one fromanother.31:50 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take otherwives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witnessbetwixt me and thee.31:51 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold thispillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 31:52 This heap bewitness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over thisheap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and thispillar unto me, for harm.31:53 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of theirfather, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his fatherIsaac.31:54 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called hisbrethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all nightin the mount.31:55 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons andhis daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned untohis place.32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and hecalled the name of that place Mahanaim.32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto theland of Seir, the country of Edom.32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lordEsau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, andstayed there until now: 32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, andmenservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, thatI may find grace in thy sight.32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thybrother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred menwith him.32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided thepeople that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,into two bands; 32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, andsmite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my fatherIsaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and tothy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 32:10 I am not worthy ofthe least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hastshewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan;and now I am become two bands.32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from thehand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and themother with the children.32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seedas the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which cameto his hand a present for Esau his brother; 32:14 Two hundred shegoats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 32:15Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls,twenty she asses, and ten foals.32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every droveby themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, andput a space betwixt drove and drove.32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brothermeeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whithergoest thou? and whose are these before thee?  32:18 Then thou shaltsay, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lordEsau: and, behold, also he is behind us.32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all thatfollowed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,when ye find him.32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. Forhe said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, andafterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged thatnight in the company.32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his twowomenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent overthat he had.32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with himuntil the breaking of the day.32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touchedthe hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out ofjoint, as he wrestled with him.32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, Iwill not let thee go, except thou bless me.32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel:for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hastprevailed.32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And heblessed him there.32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seenGod face to face, and my life is preserved.32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and hehalted upon his thigh.32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew whichshrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: becausehe touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.33:1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came,and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah,and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.33:2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leahand her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.33:3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the groundseven times, until he came near to his brother.33:4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck,and kissed him: and they wept.33:5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which Godhath graciously given thy servant.33:6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and theybowed themselves.33:7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves:and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.33:8 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? Andhe said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.33:9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hastunto thyself.33:10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace inthy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I haveseen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wastpleased with me.33:11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; becauseGod hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And heurged him, and he took it.33:12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I willgo before thee.33:13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children aretender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if menshould overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.33:14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and Iwill lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me andthe children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.33:15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk thatare with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in thesight of my lord.33:16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.33:17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and madebooths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is calledSuccoth.33:18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in theland of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tentbefore the city.33:19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent,at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundredpieces of money.33:20 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.34:1 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, wentout to see the daughters of the land.34:2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of thecountry, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.34:3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he lovedthe damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.34:4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me thisdamsel to wife.34:5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now hissons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace untilthey were come.34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to communewith him.34:7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it:and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he hadwrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thingought not to be done.34:8 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechemlongeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife.34:9 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us,and take our daughters unto you.34:10 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.34:11 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let mefind grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.34:12 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give accordingas ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.34:13 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his fatherdeceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister:34:14 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give oursister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us:34:15 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,that every male of you be circumcised; 34:16 Then will we give ourdaughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we willdwell with you, and we will become one people.34:17 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then willwe take our daughter, and we will be gone.34:18 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.34:19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he haddelight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all thehouse of his father.34:20 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city,and communed with the men of their city, saying, 34:21 These men arepeaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and tradetherein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let ustake their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them ourdaughters.34:22 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they arecircumcised.34:23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast oftheir's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwellwith us.34:24 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that wentout of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all thatwent out of the gate of his city.34:25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, thattwo of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took eachman his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.34:26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of thesword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,because they had defiled their sister.34:28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and thatwhich was in the city, and that which was in the field, 34:29 And alltheir wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took theycaptive, and spoiled even all that was in the house.34:30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to makeme to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanitesand the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gatherthemselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed,I and my house.34:31 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there:and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thoufleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were withhim, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, andchange your garments: 35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; andI will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of mydistress, and was with me in the way which I went.35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in theirhand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hidthem under the oak which was by Shechem.35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the citiesthat were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons ofJacob.35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of hisbrother.35:8 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneathBethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram,and blessed him.35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not becalled any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called hisname Israel.35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful andmultiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, andkings shall come out of thy loins; 35:12 And the land which I gaveAbraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after theewill I give the land.35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him,even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and hepoured oil thereon.35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him,Bethel.35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little wayto come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that themidwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for shedied) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called himBenjamin.35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which isBethlehem.35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar ofRachel's grave unto this day.35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower ofEdar.35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reubenwent and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it.Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben,Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, andZebulun: 35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 35:25 And thesons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 35:26 And thesons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons ofJacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the cityof Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto hispeople, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buriedhim.36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughterof Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughterof Zibeon the Hivite; 36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister ofNebajoth.36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 36:5 AndAholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons ofEsau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and allthe persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and allhis substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went intothe country from the face of his brother Jacob.36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them becauseof their cattle.36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomitesin mount Seir: 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz theson of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife ofEsau.36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, andKenaz.36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare toEliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, andMizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah thedaughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, andJaalam, and Korah.36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz thefirstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukesthat came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah.36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, dukeZerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came ofReuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau'swife.36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamahthe daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are theirdukes.36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer,and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seirin the land of Edom.36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan'ssister was Timna.36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, andEbal, Shepho, and Onam.36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: thiswas that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed theasses of Zibeon his father.36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah thedaughter of Anah.36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, andIthran, and Cheran.36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.36:28 The children of Dishan are these;

and his wife's name wasMehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,according to their families, after their places, by their names; dukeTimnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah,duke Pinon, 36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 36:43 DukeMagdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to theirhabitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father ofthe Edomites.37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, inthe land of Canaan.37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen yearsold, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with thesons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: andJoseph brought unto his father their evil report.37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because hewas the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more thanall his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably untohim.37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and theyhated him yet the more.37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I havedreamed: 37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and,lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheavesstood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? orshalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet themore for his dreams, and for his words.37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, andsaid, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun andthe moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and hisfather rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thouhast dreamed?  Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come tobow down ourselves to thee to the earth?  37:11 And his brethrenenvied him; but his father observed the saying.37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flockin Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,Here am I.37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well withthy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So hesent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering inthe field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?  37:16And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feedtheir flocks.37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say,Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and foundthem in Dothan.37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near untothem, they conspired against him to slay him.37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into somepit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shallsee what will become of his dreams.37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;and said, Let us not kill him.37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into thispit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he mightrid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours thatwas on him; 37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and thepit was empty, there was no water in it.37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyesand looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gileadwith their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carryit down to Egypt.37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slayour brother, and conceal his blood?  37:27 Come, and let us sell himto the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is ourbrother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew andlifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelitesfor twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not inthe pit; and he rent his clothes.37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;and I, whither shall I go?  37:31 And they took Joseph's coat, andkilled a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 37:32 Andthey sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to theirfather; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son'scoat or no.37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beasthath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,and mourned for his son many days.37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down intothe grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officerof Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.38:1 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from hisbrethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.38:2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose namewas Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.38:3 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.38:4 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his nameOnan.38:5 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his nameShelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.38:6 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.38:7 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD;and the LORD slew him.38:8 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, andmarry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.38:9 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came topass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it onthe ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.38:10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore heslew him also.38:11 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow atthy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lestperadventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went anddwelt in her father's house.38:12 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died;and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers toTimnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.38:13 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth upto Timnath to shear his sheep.38:14 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered herwith a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which isby the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she wasnot given unto him to wife.38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because shehad covered her face.38:16 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee,let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughterin law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest comein unto me?  38:17 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock.And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?  38:18And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave ither, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.38:19 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, andput on the garments of her widowhood.38:20 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite,to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.38:21 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is theharlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was noharlot in this place.38:22 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and alsothe men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.38:23 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.38:24 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was toldJudah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; andalso, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring herforth, and let her be burnt.38:25 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said,Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, andstaff.38:26 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been morerighteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And heknew her again no more.38:27 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,twins were in her womb.38:28 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put outhis hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarletthread, saying, This came out first.38:29 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, hisbrother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? thisbreach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.38:30 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet threadupon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.39:1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer ofPharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands ofthe Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.39:2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and hewas in the house of his master the Egyptian.39:3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORDmade all that he did to prosper in his hand.39:4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and hemade him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into hishand.39:5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseerin his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed theEgyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD wasupon all that he had in the house, and in the field.39:6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew notought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodlyperson, and well favoured.39:7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wifecast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.39:8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, mymaster wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committedall that he hath to my hand; 39:9 There is none greater in this housethan I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, becausethou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sinagainst God?  39:10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day byday, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.39:11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into thehouse to do his business; and there was none of the men of the housethere within.39:12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and heleft his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.39:13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garmentin her hand, and was fled forth, 39:14 That she called unto the men ofher house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in anHebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and Icried with a loud voice: 39:15 And it came to pass, when he heard thatI lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, andfled, and got him out.39:16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.39:17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, TheHebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me tomock me: 39:18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried,that he left his garment with me, and fled out.39:19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of hiswife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thyservant to me; that his wrath was kindled.39:20 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, aplace where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in theprison.39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave himfavour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.39:22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all theprisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, hewas the doer of it.39:23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was underhis hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, theLORD made it to prosper.40:1 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of theking of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt.40:2 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against thechief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.40:3 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard,into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.40:4 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and heserved them: and they continued a season in ward.40:5 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in onenight, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, thebutler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in theprison.40:6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked uponthem, and, behold, they were sad.40:7 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward ofhis lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?  40:8 Andthey said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is nointerpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretationsbelong to God? tell me them, I pray you.40:9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 40:10 And in the vine werethree branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shotforth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 40:11 AndPharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed theminto Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.40:12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: Thethree branches are three days: 40:13 Yet within three days shallPharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thoushalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former mannerwhen thou wast his butler.40:14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shewkindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh,and bring me out of this house: 40:15 For indeed I was stolen away outof the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing thatthey should put me into the dungeon.40:16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, hesaid unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had threewhite baskets on my head: 40:17 And in the uppermost basket there wasof all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them outof the basket upon my head.40:18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretationthereof: The three baskets are three days: 40:19 Yet within three daysshall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on atree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.40:20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the headof the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.40:21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; andhe gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 40:22 But he hanged the chiefbaker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.40:23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.41:1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaohdreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.41:2 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favouredkine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.41:3 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of theriver, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine uponthe brink of the river.41:4 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the sevenwell favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.41:5 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven earsof corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.41:6 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east windsprung up after them.41:7 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.41:8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled;and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all thewise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was nonethat could interpret them unto Pharaoh.41:9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remembermy faults this day: 41:10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and putme in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chiefbaker: 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamedeach man according to the interpretation of his dream.41:12 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant tothe captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to usour dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.41:13 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me herestored unto mine office, and him he hanged.41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought himhastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed hisraiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.41:15 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and thereis none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thoucanst understand a dream to interpret it.41:16 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shallgive Pharaoh an answer of peace.41:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood uponthe bank of the river: 41:18 And, behold, there came up out of theriver seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in ameadow: 41:19 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poorand very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all theland of Egypt for badness: 41:20 And the lean and the ill favouredkine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 41:21 And when they hadeaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; butthey were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.41:22 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in onestalk, full and good: 41:23 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin,and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 41:24 And thethin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto themagicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.41:25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: Godhath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.41:26 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears areseven years: the dream is one.41:27 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after themare seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east windshall be seven years of famine.41:28 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God isabout to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.41:29 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout allthe land of Egypt: 41:30 And there shall arise after them seven yearsof famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt;and the famine shall consume the land; 41:31 And the plenty shall notbe known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shallbe very grievous.41:32 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it isbecause the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring itto pass.41:33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, andset him over the land of Egypt.41:34 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land,and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteousyears.41:35 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come,and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food inthe cities.41:36 And that food shall be for store to the land against the sevenyears of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the landperish not through the famine.41:37 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyesof all his servants.41:38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one asthis is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?  41:39 And Pharaoh saidunto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is noneso discreet and wise as thou art: 41:40 Thou shalt be over my house,and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in thethrone will I be greater than thou.41:41 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all theland of Egypt.41:42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it uponJoseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put agold chain about his neck; 41:43 And he made him to ride in the secondchariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and hemade him ruler over all the land of Egypt.41:44 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without theeshall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.41:45 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gavehim to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. AndJoseph went out over all the land of Egypt.41:46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaohking of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, andwent throughout all the land of Egypt.41:47 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth byhandfuls.41:48 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which werein the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food ofthe field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.41:49 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,until he left numbering; for it was without number.41:50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of faminecame, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare untohim.41:51 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.41:52 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hathcaused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.41:53 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land ofEgypt, were ended.41:54 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Josephhad said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land ofEgypt there was bread.41:55 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried toPharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go untoJoseph; what he saith to you, do.41:56 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Josephopened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and thefamine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.41:57 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;because that the famine was so sore in all lands.42:1 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said untohis sons, Why do ye look one upon another?  42:2 And he said, Behold,I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, andbuy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.42:3 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.42:4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren;for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.42:5 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:for the famine was in the land of Canaan.42:6 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was thatsold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, andbowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.42:7 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himselfstrange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.42:8 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.42:9 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, andsaid unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye arecome.42:10 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thyservants come.42:11 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are nospies.42:12 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the landye are come.42:13 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of oneman in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day withour father, and one is not.42:14 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,saying, Ye are spies: 42:15 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life ofPharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother comehither.42:16 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall bekept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be anytruth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.42:17 And he put them all together into ward three days.42:18 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; forI fear God: 42:19 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be boundin the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of yourhouses: 42:20 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall yourwords be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.42:21 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerningour brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besoughtus, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.42:22 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying,Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore,behold, also his blood is required.42:23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake untothem by an interpreter.42:24 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned tothem again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, andbound him before their eyes.42:25 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and torestore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisionfor the way: and thus did he unto them.42:26 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.42:27 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender inthe inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.42:28 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, itis even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?  42:29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, andtold him all that befell unto them; saying, 42:30 The man, who is thelord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of thecountry.42:31 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 42:32 Webe twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngestis this day with our father in the land of Canaan.42:33 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shallI know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me,and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 42:34And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye areno spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you yourbrother, and ye shall traffick in the land.42:35 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they andtheir father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.42:36 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of mychildren: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjaminaway: all these things are against me.42:37 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if Ibring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring himto thee again.42:38 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brotheris dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way inthe which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow tothe grave.43:1 And the famine was sore in the land.43:2 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which theyhad brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buyus a little food.43:3 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protestunto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be withyou.43:4 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buythee food: 43:5 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down:for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except yourbrother be with you.43:6 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tellthe man whether ye had yet a brother?  43:7 And they said, The manasked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is yourfather yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him accordingto the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he wouldsay, Bring your brother down?  43:8 And Judah said unto Israel hisfather, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we maylive, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.43:9 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if Ibring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear theblame for ever: 43:10 For except we had lingered, surely now we hadreturned this second time.43:11 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, dothis; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carrydown the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, andmyrrh, nuts, and almonds: 43:12 And take double money in your hand;and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carryit again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 43:13 Takealso your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 43:14 And GodAlmighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away yourother brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I ambereaved.43:15 And the men took that present, and they took double money intheir hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, andstood before Joseph.43:16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler ofhis house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for thesemen shall dine with me at noon.43:17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men intoJoseph's house.43:18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph'shouse; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in oursacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasionagainst us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.43:19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and theycommuned with him at the door of the house, 43:20 And said, O sir, wecame indeed down at the first time to buy food: 43:21 And it came topass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold,every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in fullweight: and we have brought it again in our hand.43:22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.43:23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God ofyour father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.And he brought Simeon out unto them.43:24 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave themwater, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.43:25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: forthey heard that they should eat bread there.43:26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present whichwas in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to theearth.43:27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your fatherwell, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?  43:28 And theyanswered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive.And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.43:29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, hismother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spakeunto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.43:30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon hisbrother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber,and wept there.43:31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, andsaid, Set on bread.43:32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves,and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: becausethe Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is anabomination unto the Egyptians.43:33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to hisbirthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the menmarvelled one at another.43:34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: butBenjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And theydrank, and were merry with him.44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men'ssacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's moneyin his sack's mouth.44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of theyoungest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word thatJoseph had spoken.44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, theyand their asses.44:4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thoudost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil forgood?  44:5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and wherebyindeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? Godforbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 44:8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we broughtagain unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we stealout of thy lord's house silver or gold?  44:9 With whomsoever of thyservants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord'sbondmen.44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: hewith whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.44:11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,and opened every man his sack.44:12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at theyoungest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, andreturned to the city.44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he wasyet there: and they fell before him on the ground.44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?  44:16 And Judahsaid, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?  or howshall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thyservants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also withwhom the cup is found.44:17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man inwhose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you,get you up in peace unto your father.44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thyservant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let notthine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or abrother?  44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an oldman, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother isdead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, thatI may set mine eyes upon him.44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: forif he should leave his father, his father would die.44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brothercome down with you, ye shall see my face no more.44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father,we told him the words of my lord.44:25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be withus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, exceptour youngest brother be with us.44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wifebare me two sons: 44:28 And the one went out from me, and I said,Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 44:29 And if yetake this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring downmy gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the ladbe not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;44:31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not withus, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairsof thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame tomy father for ever.44:33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of thelad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.45:1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stoodby him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And therestood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto hisbrethren.45:2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaohheard.45:3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my fatheryet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they weretroubled at his presence.45:4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you.And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom yesold into Egypt.45:5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that yesold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.45:6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yetthere are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing norharvest.45:7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in theearth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.45:8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hathmade me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a rulerthroughout all the land of Egypt.45:9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saiththy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,tarry not: 45:10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thoushalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children'schildren, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 45:11And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine;lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty.45:12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.45:13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of allthat ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.45:14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; andBenjamin wept upon his neck.45:15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: andafter that his brethren talked with him.45:16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and hisservants.45:17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 45:18 Andtake your father and your households, and come unto me: and I willgive you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat ofthe land.45:19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of theland of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring yourfather, and come.45:20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land ofEgypt is your's.45:21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision forthe way.45:22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but toBenjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes ofraiment.45:23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses ladenwith the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn andbread and meat for his father by the way.45:24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he saidunto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.45:25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaanunto Jacob their father, 45:26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yetalive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob'sheart fainted, for he believed them not.45:27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had saidunto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carryhim, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 45:28 And Israel said,It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him beforeI die.46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came toBeersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go downinto Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 46:4 I willgo down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee upagain: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carriedJacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in thewagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they hadgotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all hisseed with him: 46:7 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, hisdaughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he withhim into Egypt.46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, andCarmi.46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, andZarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons ofPharez were Hezron and Hamul.46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, andShimron.46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob inPadanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and hisdaughters were thirty and three.46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,and Arodi, and Areli.46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah,and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah hisdaughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh andEphraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bareunto him.46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all thesouls were fourteen.46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, andShillem.46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel hisdaughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out ofhis loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescoreand six; 46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt,were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came intoEgypt, were threescore and ten.46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his faceunto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israelhis father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell onhis neck, and wept on his neck a good while.46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seenthy face, because thou art yet alive.46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house,I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and myfather's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feedcattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and allthat they have.46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, andshall say, What is your occupation?  46:34 That ye shall say, Thyservants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now,both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land ofGoshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.47:1 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and mybrethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have,are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the landof Goshen.47:2 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presentedthem unto Pharaoh.47:3 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? Andthey said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and alsoour fathers.47:4 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are wecome; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for thefamine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, letthy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.47:5 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thybrethren are come unto thee: 47:6 The land of Egypt is before thee; inthe best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in theland of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activityamong them, then make them rulers over my cattle.47:7 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him beforePharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?  47:9 And Jacobsaid unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are anhundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years ofmy life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of thelife of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.47:10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.47:11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them apossession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the landof Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.47:12 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all hisfather's household, with bread, according to their families.47:13 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was verysore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted byreason of the famine.47:14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the landof Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought:and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.47:15 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land ofCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.47:16 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for yourcattle, if money fail.47:17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave thembread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattleof the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for alltheir cattle for that year.47:18 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that ourmoney is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is notought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:47:19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servantsunto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, thatthe land be not desolate.47:20 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for theEgyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed overthem: so the land became Pharaoh's.47:21 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end ofthe borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.47:22 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests hada portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion whichPharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.47:23 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you thisday and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shallsow the land.47:24 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall givethe fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, forseed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households,and for food for your little ones.47:25 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace inthe sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.47:26 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of thepriests only, which became not Pharaoh's.47:27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen;and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multipliedexceedingly.47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so thewhole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.47:29 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called hisson Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and trulywith me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 47:30 But I will lie withmy fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in theirburyingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.47:31 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israelbowed himself upon the bed's head.48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,Manasseh and Ephraim.48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh untothee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luzin the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 48:4 And said unto me, Behold,I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of theea multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after theefor an everlasting possession.48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born untothee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, aremine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,and shall be called after the name of their brethren in theirinheritance.48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in theland of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to comeunto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the sameis Bethlehem.48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?  48:9And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath givenme in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and Iwill bless them.48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could notsee.And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embracedthem.48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowedhimself with his face to the earth.48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand towardIsrael's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel'sright hand, and brought them near unto him.48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it uponEphraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh'shead, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathersAbraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long untothis day, 48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless thelads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathersAbraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst ofthe earth.48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon thehead of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this isthe firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but trulyhis younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shallbecome a multitude of nations.48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israelbless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he setEphraim before Manasseh.48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall bewith you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with mybow.49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselvestogether, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the lastdays.49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; andhearken unto Israel your father.49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of mystrength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up tothy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in theirhabitations.49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man,and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for itwas cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shallbe in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow downbefore thee.49:9 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up:he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shallrouse him up?  49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor alawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shallthe gathering of the people be.49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto thechoice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in theblood of grapes: 49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teethwhite with milk.49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be foran haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it waspleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant untotribute.49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, thatbiteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at thelast.49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royaldainties.49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;whose branches run over the wall: 49:23 The archers have sorelygrieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 49:24 But his bow abodein strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the handsof the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone ofIsrael:) 49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; andby the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, andof the womb: 49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed abovethe blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of theeverlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on thecrown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devourthe prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it thattheir father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according tohis blessing he blessed them.49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gatheredunto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in thefield of Ephron the Hittite, 49:30 In the cave that is in the field ofMachpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abrahambought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of aburyingplace.49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buriedIsaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein wasfrom the children of Heth.49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, hegathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and wasgathered unto his people.50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, andkissed him.50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm hisfather: and the physicians embalmed Israel.50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled thedays of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for himthreescore and ten days.50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake untothe house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 50:5 My father mademe swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me inthe land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me goup, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as hemade thee swear.50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up allthe servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the eldersof the land of Egypt, 50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and hisbrethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and theirflocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it wasa very great company.50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyondJordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:and he made a mourning for his father seven days.50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw themourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourningto the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,which is beyond Jordan.50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 50:13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him inthe cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with thefield for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, beforeMamre.50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and allthat went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried hisfather.50:15 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, theysaid, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite usall the evil which we did unto him.50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father didcommand before he died, saying, 50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph,Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive thetrespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph weptwhen they spake unto him.50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; andthey said, Behold, we be thy servants.50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place ofGod?  50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meantit unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much peoplealive.50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your littleones.And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: andJoseph lived an hundred and ten years.50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: thechildren also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up uponJoseph's knees.50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surelyvisit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swareto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, Godwill surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and theyembalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.The Second Book of Moses:  Called Exodus1:1 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which cameinto Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, andBenjamin, 1:4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.1:5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventysouls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.1:6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.1:7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increasedabundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the landwas filled with them.1:8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.1:9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children ofIsrael are more and mightier than we: 1:10 Come on, let us deal wiselywith them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when therefalleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fightagainst us, and so get them up out of the land.1:11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them withtheir burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom andRaamses.1:12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied andgrew.And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.1:13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve withrigour: 1:14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, inmorter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: alltheir service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.1:15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which thename of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 1:16 Andhe said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, andsee them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: butif it be a daughter, then she shall live.1:17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egyptcommanded them, but saved the men children alive.1:18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said untothem, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men childrenalive?  1:19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrewwomen are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and aredelivered ere the midwives come in unto them.1:20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the peoplemultiplied, and waxed very mighty.1:21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that hemade them houses.1:22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that isborn ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall savealive.2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife adaughter of Levi.2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him thathe was a goodly child, she hid him three months.2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark ofbulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the childtherein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at theriver; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when shesaw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, thebabe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of theHebrews' children.2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call tothee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child forthee?  2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid wentand called the child's mother.2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, andnurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women tookthe child, and nursed it.2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter,and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,Because I drew him out of the water.2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that hewent out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spiedan Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that therewas no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of theHebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  2:14 And he said, Who made thee aprince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thoukilledst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thingis known.2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. ButMoses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:and he sat down by a well.2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came anddrew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood upand helped them, and watered their flock.2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it thatye are come so soon to day?  2:19 And they said, An Egyptian deliveredus out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough forus, and watered the flock.2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it thatye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave MosesZipporah his daughter.2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for hesaid, I have been a stranger in a strange land.2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egyptdied: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, andthey cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenantwith Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respectunto them.3:1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priestof Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, andcame to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.3:2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire outof the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burnedwith fire, and the bush was not consumed.3:3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight,why the bush is not burnt.3:4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called untohim out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,Here am I.3:5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thyfeet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.3:6 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for hewas afraid to look upon God.3:7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my peoplewhich are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of theirtaskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 3:8 And I am come down todeliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them upout of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowingwith milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and theHittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, andthe Jebusites.3:9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is comeunto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptiansoppress them.3:10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thoumayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?3:12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be atoken unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forththe people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children ofIsrael, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent meunto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I sayunto them?  3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said,Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent meunto you.3:15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto thechildren of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this ismy name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them,The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and ofJacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seenthat which is done to you in Egypt: 3:17 And I have said, I will bringyou up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites,and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and theHivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.3:18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thouand the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall sayunto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let usgo, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that wemay sacrifice to the LORD our God.3:19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, notby a mighty hand.3:20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all mywonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he willlet you go.3:21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.3:22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her thatsojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, andraiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon yourdaughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.4:1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believeme, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath notappeared unto thee.4:2 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And hesaid, A rod.4:3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground,and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.4:4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it bythe tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became arod in his hand: 4:5 That they may believe that the LORD God of theirfathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,hath appeared unto thee.4:6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand intothy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took itout, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.4:7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put hishand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and,behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.4:8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neitherhearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe thevoice of the latter sign.4:9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these twosigns, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of thewater of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water whichthou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.4:10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but Iam slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.4:11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or whomaketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I theLORD?  4:12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teachthee what thou shalt say.4:13 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of himwhom thou wilt send.4:14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said,Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeththee, he will be glad in his heart.4:15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and Iwill be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what yeshall do.4:16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be,even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to himinstead of God.4:17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shaltdo signs.4:18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and saidunto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren whichare in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said toMoses, Go in peace.4:19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:for all the men are dead which sought thy life.4:20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass,and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God inhis hand.4:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return intoEgypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I haveput in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not letthe people go.4:22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel ismy son, even my firstborn: 4:23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go,that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I willslay thy son, even thy firstborn.4:24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him,and sought to kill him.4:25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of herson, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband artthou to me.4:26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,because of the circumcision.4:27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.4:28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him,and all the signs which he had commanded him.4:29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders ofthe children of Israel: 4:30 And Aaron spake all the words which theLORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of thepeople.4:31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD hadvisited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon theiraffliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thussaith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold afeast unto me in the wilderness.5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice tolet Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go,we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice untothe LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with thesword.5:4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses andAaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.5:5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, andye make them rest from their burdens.5:6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people,and their officers, saying, 5:7 Ye shall no more give the people strawto make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw forthemselves.5:8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, yeshall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they beidle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.5:9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labourtherein; and let them not regard vain words.5:10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will notgive you straw.5:11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of yourwork shall be diminished.5:12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land ofEgypt to gather stubble instead of straw.5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, yourdaily tasks, as when there was straw.5:14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh'staskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Whereforehave ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and today, as heretofore?  5:15 Then the officers of the children of Israelcame and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus withthy servants?  5:16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, andthey say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; butthe fault is in thine own people.5:17 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let usgo and do sacrifice to the LORD.5:18 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be givenyou, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.5:19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they werein evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from yourbricks of your daily task.5:20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they cameforth from Pharaoh: 5:21 And they said unto them, The LORD look uponyou, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in theeyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword intheir hand to slay us.5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hastthou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?5:23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath doneevil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.6:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will doto Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with astrong hand shall he drive them out of his land.6:2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 6:3And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the nameof God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.6:4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give themthe land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they werestrangers.6:5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whomthe Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.6:6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and Iwill bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I willrid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretchedout arm, and with great judgments: 6:7 And I will take you to me for apeople, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am theLORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of theEgyptians.6:8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I didswear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will giveit you for an heritage: I am the LORD.6:9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkenednot unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.6:10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:11 Go in, speak untoPharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out ofhis land.6:12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children ofIsrael have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, whoam of uncircumcised lips?  6:13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and untoAaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and untoPharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the landof Egypt.6:14 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reubenthe firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: thesebe the families of Reuben.6:15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are thefamilies of Simeon.6:16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to theirgenerations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of thelife of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.6:17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to theirfamilies.6:18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and threeyears.6:19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the familiesof Levi according to their generations.6:20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and shebare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were anhundred and thirty and seven years.6:21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.6:22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.6:23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister ofNaashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, andIthamar.6:24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: theseare the families of the Korhites.6:25 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putielto wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathersof the Levites according to their families.6:26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring outthe children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to theirarmies.6:27 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring outthe children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.6:28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses inthe land of Egypt, 6:29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I amthe LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say untothee.6:30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcisedlips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  7:1 And the LORD saidunto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thybrother shall be thy prophet.7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brothershall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out ofhis land.7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and mywonders in the land of Egypt.7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my handupon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children ofIsrael, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretchforth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel fromamong them.7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and threeyears old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 7:9 WhenPharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: thenthou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh,and it shall become a serpent.7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as theLORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, andbefore his servants, and it became a serpent.7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now themagicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with theirenchantments.7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them;as the LORD had said.7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, herefuseth to let the people go.7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto thewater; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; andthe rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hathsent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me inthe wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waterswhich are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shallstink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of theriver.7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, andstretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools ofwater, that they may become blood; and that there may be bloodthroughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and invessels of stone.7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he liftedup the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sightof Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters thatwere in the river were turned to blood.7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, andthe Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there wasblood throughout all the land of Egypt.7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: andPharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as theLORD had said.7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he sethis heart to this also.7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water todrink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smittenthe river.8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.8:2 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thyborders with frogs: 8:3 And the river shall bring forth frogsabundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thybedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, andupon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:8:4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, andupon all thy servants.8:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thinehand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over theponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.8:6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and thefrogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.8:7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought upfrogs upon the land of Egypt.8:8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat theLORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; andI will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.8:9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreatfor thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy thefrogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the riveronly?  8:10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according tothy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORDour God.8:11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, andfrom thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the riveronly.8:12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried untothe LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.8:13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogsdied out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.8:14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened hisheart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.8:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thyrod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become licethroughout all the land of Egypt.8:17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and inbeast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land ofEgypt.8:18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forthlice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.8:19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God:and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; asthe LORD had said.8:20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, andstand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say untohim, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.8:21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will sendswarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people,and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full ofswarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.8:22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which mypeople dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thoumayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.8:23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: tomorrow shall this sign be.8:24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of fliesinto the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into allthe land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm offlies.8:25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,sacrifice to your God in the land.8:26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrificethe abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall wesacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and willthey not stone us?  8:27 We will go three days' journey into thewilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.8:28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to theLORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:intreat for me.8:29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreatthe LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from hisservants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh dealdeceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to theLORD.8:30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.8:31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removedthe swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from hispeople; there remained not one.8:32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither wouldhe let the people go.9:1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that theymay serve me.9:2 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 9:3Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field,upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, andupon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.9:4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and thecattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is thechildren's of Israel.9:5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORDshall do this thing in the land.9:6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle ofEgypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.9:7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle ofthe Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didnot let the people go.9:8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfulsof ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heavenin the sight of Pharaoh.9:9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shallbe a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast,throughout all the land of Egypt.9:10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; andMoses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breakingforth with blains upon man, and upon beast.9:11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of theboils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all theEgyptians.9:12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened notunto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.9:13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, andstand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of theHebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.9:14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, andupon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know thatthere is none like me in all the earth.9:15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thypeople with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.9:16 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for toshew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout allthe earth.9:17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wiltnot let them go?  9:18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will causeit to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt sincethe foundation thereof even until now.9:19 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hastin the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in thefield, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down uponthem, and they shall die.9:20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaohmade his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 9:21 And hethat regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and hiscattle in the field.9:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand towardheaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, andupon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land ofEgypt.9:23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORDsent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and theLORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.9:24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since itbecame a nation.9:25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that wasin the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of thefield, and brake every tree of the field.9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,was there no hail.9:27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said untothem, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and mypeople are wicked.9:28 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mightythunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay nolonger.9:29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, Iwill spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shallcease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know howthat the earth is the LORD's.9:30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yetfear the LORD God.9:31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was inthe ear, and the flax was bolled.9:32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were notgrown up.9:33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroadhis hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and therain was not poured upon the earth.9:34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunderswere ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and hisservants.9:35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let thechildren of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.10:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I havehardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shewthese my signs before him: 10:2 And that thou mayest tell in the earsof thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt,and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that Iam the LORD.10:3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thussaith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humblethyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.10:4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow willI bring the locusts into thy coast: 10:5 And they shall cover the faceof the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shalleat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto youfrom the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out ofthe field: 10:6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of allthy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thyfathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that theywere upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went outfrom Pharaoh.10:7 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man bea snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD theirGod: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  10:8 And Moses andAaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go,serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  10:9 AndMoses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sonsand with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go;for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.10:10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I willlet you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.10:11 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that yedid desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.10:12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over theland of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land ofEgypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hathleft.10:13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, andthe LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all thatnight; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.10:14 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested inall the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them therewere no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.10:15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the landwas darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all thefruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not anygreen thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through allthe land of Egypt.10:16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, Ihave sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.10:17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, andintreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this deathonly.10:18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.10:19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took awaythe locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not onelocust in all the coasts of Egypt.10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not letthe children of Israel go.10:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand towardheaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, evendarkness which may be felt.10:22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there wasa thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 10:23 They sawnot one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: butall the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.10:24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD;only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little onesalso go with you.10:25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burntofferings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.10:26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof beleft behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; andwe know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let themgo.10:28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed tothyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thoushalt die.10:29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face againno more.11:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague moreupon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hencealtogether.11:2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow ofhis neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver andjewels of gold.11:3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of theEgyptians.Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in thesight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.11:4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go outinto the midst of Egypt: 11:5 And all the firstborn in the land ofEgypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon histhrone, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind themill; and all the firstborn of beasts.11:6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.11:7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog movehis tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORDdoth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.11:8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow downthemselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people thatfollow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out fromPharaoh in a great anger.11:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.11:10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: andthe LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let thechildren of Israel go out of his land.12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egyptsaying, 12:2 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: itshall be the first month of the year to you.12:3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In thetenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 12:4 Andif the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbournext unto his house take it according to the number of the souls;every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.12:5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: yeshall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 12:6 And ye shallkeep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the wholeassembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.12:7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two sideposts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eatit.12:8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, andunleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.12:9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast withfire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.12:10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; andthat which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.12:11 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes onyour feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste:it is the LORD's passover.12:12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and willsmite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; andagainst all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses whereye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plagueshall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.12:14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keepit a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it afeast by an ordinance for ever.12:15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day yeshall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eatethleavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soulshall be cut off from Israel.12:16 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and inthe seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no mannerof work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat,that only may be done of you.12:17 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in thisselfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by anordinance for ever.12:18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even,ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of themonth at even.12:19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: forwhosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cutoff from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or bornin the land.12:20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall yeeat unleavened bread.12:21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said untothem, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, andkill the passover.12:22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the bloodthat is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side postswith the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out atthe door of his house until the morning.12:23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and whenhe seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, theLORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer tocome in unto your houses to smite you.12:24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and tothy sons for ever.12:25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which theLORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keepthis service.12:26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say untoyou, What mean ye by this service?  12:27 That ye shall say, It is thesacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of thechildren of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, anddelivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.12:28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD hadcommanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.12:29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all thefirstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that saton his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in thedungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.12:30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, andall the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there wasnot a house where there was not one dead.12:31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children ofIsrael; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.12:32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and begone; and bless me also.12:33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they mightsend them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.12:34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, theirkneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.12:35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels ofgold, and raiment: 12:36 And the LORD gave the people favour in thesight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things asthey required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.12:37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.12:38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, andherds, even very much cattle.12:39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they broughtforth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrustout of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared forthemselves any victual.12:40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt inEgypt, was four hundred and thirty years.12:41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirtyyears, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts ofthe LORD went out from the land of Egypt.12:42 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringingthem out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to beobserved of all the children of Israel in their generations.12:43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance ofthe passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 12:44 But everyman's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcisedhim, then shall he eat thereof.12:45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.12:46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth oughtof the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bonethereof.12:47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.12:48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep thepassover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then lethim come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in theland: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.12:49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the strangerthat sojourneth among you.12:50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Mosesand Aaron, so did they.12:51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bringthe children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Sanctify unto me allthe firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children ofIsrael, both of man and of beast: it is mine.13:3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which yecame out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength ofhand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavenedbread be eaten.13:4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.13:5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land ofthe Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites,and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, aland flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service inthis month.13:6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventhday shall be a feast to the LORD.13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall noleavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seenwith thee in all thy quarters.13:8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is donebecause of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out ofEgypt.13:9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for amemorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth:for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.13:10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from yearto year.13:11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land ofthe Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shallgive it thee, 13:12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all thatopeneth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast whichthou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.13:13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; andif thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and allthe firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.13:14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength ofhand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:13:15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, thatthe LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both thefirstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice tothe LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all thefirstborn of my children I redeem.13:16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontletsbetween thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forthout of Egypt.13:17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, thatGod led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines,although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the peoplerepent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 13:18 But God ledthe people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea:and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.13:19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitlysworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; andye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.13:20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,in the edge of the wilderness.13:21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, tolead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give themlight; to go by day and night: 13:22 He took not away the pillar ofthe cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before thepeople.14:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth,between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shallye encamp by the sea.14:3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They areentangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow afterthem; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; thatthe Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.14:5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and theheart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people,and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go fromserving us?  14:6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his peoplewith him: 14:7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all thechariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.14:8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and hepursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel wentout with an high hand.14:9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariotsof Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook themencamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.14:10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted uptheir eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and theywere sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.14:11 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thoudealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  14:12 Is not thisthe word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that wemay serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve theEgyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.14:13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, andsee the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: forthe Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again nomore for ever.14:14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.14:15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 14:16 Butlift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, anddivide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground throughthe midst of the sea.14:17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, andthey shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, andupon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.14:18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I havegotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon hishorsemen.14:19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went frombefore their face, and stood behind them: 14:20 And it came betweenthe camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloudand darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that theone came not near the other all the night.14:21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORDcaused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, andmade the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.14:22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea uponthe dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their righthand, and on their left.14:23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midstof the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.14:24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD lookedunto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of thecloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 14:25 And took offtheir chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that theEgyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORDfighteth for them against the Egyptians.14:26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over thesea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon theirchariots, and upon their horsemen.14:27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the seareturned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptiansfled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst ofthe sea.14:28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and thehorsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea afterthem; there remained not so much as one of them.14:29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst ofthe sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, andon their left.14:30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of theEgyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.14:31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon theEgyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, andhis servant Moses.15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto theLORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hathtriumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea.15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God,and I will exalt him.15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: hischosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as astone.15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy righthand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrownthem that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, whichconsumed them as stubble.15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gatheredtogether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths werecongealed in the heart of the sea.15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide thespoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, myhand shall destroy them.15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sankas lead in the mighty waters.15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee,glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  15:12 Thoustretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hastredeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holyhabitation.15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold onthe inhabitants of Palestina.15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaanshall melt away.15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thinearm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, OLORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain ofthine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for theeto dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands haveestablished.15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with hishorsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of thesea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in themidst of the sea.15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrelin her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels andwith dances.15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hathtriumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into thesea.15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out intothe wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,and found no water.15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the watersof Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was calledMarah.15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall wedrink?  15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him atree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were madesweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there heproved them, 15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to thevoice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in hissight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all hisstatutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I havebrought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, andthreescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.16:1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregationof the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which isbetween Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month aftertheir departing out of the land of Egypt.16:2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmuredagainst Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 16:3 And the children ofIsrael said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of theLORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when wedid eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into thiswilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.16:4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread fromheaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rateevery day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, orno.16:5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shallprepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much asthey gather daily.16:6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, Ateven, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from theland of Egypt: 16:7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory ofthe LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: andwhat are we, that ye murmur against us?  16:8 And Moses said, Thisshall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat,and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth yourmurmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? yourmurmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.16:9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of thechildren of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard yourmurmurings.16:10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregationof the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.16:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:12 I have heard themurmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At evenye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread;and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.16:13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, andcovered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.16:14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face ofthe wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoarfrost on the ground.16:15 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one toanother, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses saidunto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.16:16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of itevery man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according tothe number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are inhis tents.16:17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, someless.16:18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered muchhad nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; theygathered every man according to his eating.16:19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.16:20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of themleft of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moseswas wroth with them.16:21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to hiseating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.16:22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twiceas much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of thecongregation came and told Moses.16:23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, Tomorrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that whichye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that whichremaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.16:24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it didnot stink, neither was there any worm therein.16:25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath untothe LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.16:26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which isthe sabbath, in it there shall be none.16:27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people onthe seventh day for to gather, and they found none.16:28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep mycommandments and my laws?  16:29 See, for that the LORD hath given youthe sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of twodays; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his placeon the seventh day.16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.16:31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and itwas like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafersmade with honey.16:32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may seethe bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I broughtyou forth from the land of Egypt.16:33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full ofmanna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for yourgenerations.16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before theTestimony, to be kept.16:35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until theycame to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto theborders of the land of Canaan.16:36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.17:1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed fromthe wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to thecommandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was nowater for the people to drink.17:2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give uswater that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye withme? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?  17:3 And the people thirstedthere for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said,Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to killus and our children and our cattle with thirst?  17:4 And Moses criedunto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they bealmost ready to stone me.17:5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and takewith thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotestthe river, take in thine hand, and go.17:6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it,that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the eldersof Israel.17:7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, becauseof the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted theLORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?  17:8 Then came Amalek,and fought with Israel in Rephidim.17:9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fightwith Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with therod of God in mine hand.17:10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek:and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.17:11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israelprevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.17:12 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put itunder him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands,the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and hishands were steady until the going down of the sun.17:13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge ofthe sword.17:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in abook, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly putout the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.17:15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of itJehovahnissi: 17:16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that theLORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.18:1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard ofall that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and thatthe LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 18:2 Then Jethro, Moses'father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,18:3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; forhe said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 18:4 And the name ofthe other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was minehelp, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 18:5 And Jethro,Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses intothe wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 18:6 And hesaid unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thywife, and her two sons with her.18:7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance,and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and theycame into the tent.18:8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done untoPharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travailthat had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.18:9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had doneto Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.18:10 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you outof the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hathdelivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in thething wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.18:12 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering andsacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, toeat bread with Moses' father in law before God.18:13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge thepeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto theevening.18:14 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people,he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittestthou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning untoeven?  18:15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the peoplecome unto me to enquire of God: 18:16 When they have a matter, theycome unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make themknow the statutes of God, and his laws.18:17 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thoudoest is not good.18:18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that iswith thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able toperform it thyself alone.18:19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and Godshall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thoumayest bring the causes unto God: 18:20 And thou shalt teach themordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they mustwalk, and the work that they must do.18:21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, suchas fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such overthem, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers offifties, and rulers of tens: 18:22 And let them judge the people atall seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bringunto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it beeasier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.18:23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thoushalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to theirplace in peace.18:24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and didall that he had said.18:25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them headsover the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers offifties, and rulers of tens.18:26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes theybrought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.18:27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way intohis own land.19:1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forthout of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wildernessof Sinai.19:2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desertof Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel campedbefore the mount.19:3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out ofthe mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, andtell the children of Israel; 19:4 Ye have seen what I did unto theEgyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you untomyself.19:5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep mycovenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above allpeople: for all the earth is mine: 19:6 And ye shall be unto me akingdom of priests, and an holy nation.These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children ofIsrael.19:7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laidbefore their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.19:8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORDhath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the peopleunto the LORD.19:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thickcloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believethee for ever.And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.19:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctifythem to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 19:11 Andbe ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will comedown in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.19:12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touchthe border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put todeath: 19:13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely bestoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall notlive: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.19:14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, andsanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.19:15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:come not at your wives.19:16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that therewere thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, andthe voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people thatwas in the camp trembled.19:17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet withGod; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.19:18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORDdescended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smokeof a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.19:19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louderand louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.19:20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of themount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moseswent up.19:21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lestthey break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.19:22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctifythemselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.19:23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mountSinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, andsanctify it.19:24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shaltcome up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and thepeople break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forthupon them.19:25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.20:1 And God spake all these words, saying, 20:2 I am the LORD thyGod, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of thehouse of bondage.20:3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.20:4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likenessof any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,or that is in the water under the earth.20:5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for Ithe LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of thefathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of themthat hate me; 20:6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that loveme, and keep my commandments.20:7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for theLORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.20:8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.20:9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 20:10 But theseventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt notdo any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, northy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thygates: 20:11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea,and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore theLORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long uponthe land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.20:13 Thou shalt not kill.20:14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.20:15 Thou shalt not steal.20:16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.20:17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covetthy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor hisox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.20:18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, andthe noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when thepeople saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.20:19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear:but let not God speak with us, lest we die.20:20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come toprove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sinnot.20:21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto thethick darkness where God was.20:22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto thechildren of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you fromheaven.20:23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye makeunto you gods of gold.20:24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrificethereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, andthine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come untothee, and I will bless thee.20:25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not buildit of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hastpolluted it.20:26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thynakedness be not discovered thereon.21:1 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.21:2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and inthe seventh he shall go out free for nothing.21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he weremarried, then his wife shall go out with him.21:4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sonsor daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and heshall go out by himself.21:5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife,and my children; I will not go out free: 21:6 Then his master shallbring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, orunto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with anaul; and he shall serve him for ever.21:7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall notgo out as the menservants do.21:8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself,then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nationhe shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.21:9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with herafter the manner of daughters.21:10 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her dutyof marriage, shall he not diminish.21:11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go outfree without money.21:12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put todeath.21:13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.21:14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay himwith guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.21:15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surelyput to death.21:16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be foundin his hand, he shall surely be put to death.21:17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely beput to death.21:18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone,or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 21:19 If herise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smotehim be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shallcause him to be thoroughly healed.21:20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and hedie under his hand; he shall be surely punished.21:21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not bepunished: for he is his money.21:22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruitdepart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surelypunished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and heshall pay as the judges determine.21:23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,21:24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,21:25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.21:26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of hismaid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.21:27 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant'stooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.21:28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shallbe surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner ofthe ox shall be quit.21:29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, andit hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, butthat he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and hisowner also shall be put to death.21:30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give forthe ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.21:31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, accordingto this judgment shall it be done unto him.21:32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shallgive unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall bestoned.21:33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, andnot cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 21:34 The owner of thepit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and thedead beast shall be his.21:35 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shallsell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox alsothey shall divide.21:36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; andthe dead shall be his own.22:1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it;he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.22:2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,there shall no blood be shed for him.22:3 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him;for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shallbe sold for his theft.22:4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it beox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.22:5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shallput in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the bestof his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he makerestitution.22:6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks ofcorn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; hethat kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.22:7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep,and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, lethim pay double.22:8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall bebrought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto hisneighbour's goods.22:9 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, forsheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which anotherchallengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before thejudges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double untohis neighbour.22:10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or asheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away,no man seeing it: 22:11 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between themboth, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; andthe owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.22:12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto theowner thereof.22:13 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, andhe shall not make good that which was torn.22:14 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, ordie, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make itgood.22:15 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good:if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.22:16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie withher, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.22:17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall paymoney according to the dowry of virgins.22:18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.22:19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.22:20 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, heshall be utterly destroyed.22:21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye werestrangers in the land of Egypt.22:22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.22:23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, Iwill surely hear their cry; 22:24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and Iwill kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and yourchildren fatherless.22:25 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon himusury.22:26 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thoushalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 22:27 For thatis his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall hesleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I willhear; for I am gracious.22:28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thypeople.22:29 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, andof thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.22:30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt giveit me.22:31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any fleshthat is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.23:1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with thewicked to be an unrighteous witness.23:2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thouspeak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 23:3 Neithershalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.23:4 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shaltsurely bring it back to him again.23:5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under hisburden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help withhim.23:6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.23:7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteousslay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.23:8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, andperverteth the words of the righteous.23:9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart ofa stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.23:10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in thefruits thereof: 23:11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest andlie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leavethe beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal withthy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.23:12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thoushalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thyhandmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.23:13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: andmake no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard outof thy mouth.23:14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.23:15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eatunleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the timeappointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: andnone shall appear before me empty:) 23:16 And the feast of harvest,the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: andthe feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thouhast gathered in thy labours out of the field.23:17 Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before theLORD God.23:18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavenedbread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.23:19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring intothe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in hismother's milk.23:20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.23:21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he willnot pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.23:22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that Ispeak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversaryunto thine adversaries.23:23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto theAmorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites,the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.23:24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor doafter their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quitebreak down their images.23:25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thybread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst ofthee.23:26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thyland: the number of thy days I will fulfil.23:27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the peopleto whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn theirbacks unto thee.23:28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out theHivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.23:29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest theland become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply againstthee.23:30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,until thou be increased, and inherit the land.23:31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea ofthe Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I willdeliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand;

that there be no plague among them, when thounumberest them.30:13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that arenumbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekelis twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD.30:14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twentyyears old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD.30:15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give lessthan half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to makean atonement for your souls.30:16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children ofIsrael, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of thecongregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israelbefore the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.30:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:18 Thou shalt alsomake a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: andthou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and thealtar, and thou shalt put water therein.30:19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feetthereat: 30:20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation,they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come nearto the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD:30:21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they dienot: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and tohis seed throughout their generations.30:22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 30:23 Take thou alsounto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and ofsweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, andof sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 30:24 And of cassiafive hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oilolive an hin: 30:25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, anointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holyanointing oil.30:26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregationtherewith, and the ark of the testimony, 30:27 And the table and allhis vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar ofincense, 30:28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels,and the laver and his foot.30:29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.30:30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Thisshall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.30:32 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye makeany other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and itshall be holy unto you.30:33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any ofit upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.30:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with purefrankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 30:35 And thoushalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary,tempered together, pure and holy: 30:36 And thou shalt beat some of itvery small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle ofthe congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto youmost holy.30:37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not maketo yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be untothee holy for the LORD.30:38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shalleven be cut off from his people.31:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:2 See, I have called byname Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:31:3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and inunderstanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,31:4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and inbrass, 31:5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving oftimber, to work in all manner of workmanship.31:6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son ofAhisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wisehearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I havecommanded thee; 31:7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the arkof the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all thefurniture of the tabernacle, 31:8 And the table and his furniture, andthe pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,31:9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and thelaver and his foot, 31:10 And the cloths of service, and the holygarments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, tominister in the priest's office, 31:11 And the anointing oil, andsweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I havecommanded thee shall they do.31:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:13 Speak thou alsounto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep:for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; thatye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.31:14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoeverdoeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among hispeople.31:15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath ofrest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day,he shall surely be put to death.31:16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, toobserve the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetualcovenant.31:17 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: forin six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day herested, and was refreshed.31:18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communingwith him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone,written with the finger of God.32:1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out ofthe mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, andsaid unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as forthis Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, wewot not what is become of him.32:2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, whichare in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,and bring them unto me.32:3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were intheir ears, and brought them unto Aaron.32:4 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with agraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, Thesebe thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.32:5 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaronmade proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.32:6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burntofferings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eatand to drink, and rose up to play.32:7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corruptedthemselves: 32:8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which Icommanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshippedit, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, OIsrael, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.32:9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 32:10 Now therefore let me alone,that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them:and I will make of thee a great nation.32:11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doththy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forthout of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?32:12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief didhe bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume themfrom the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent ofthis evil against thy people.32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thouswarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply yourseed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken ofwill I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.32:14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do untohis people.32:15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the twotables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written onboth their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.32:16 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was thewriting of God, graven upon the tables.32:17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.32:18 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but thenoise of them that sing do I hear.32:19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, thathe saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and hecast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.32:20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in thefire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and madethe children of Israel drink of it.32:21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, thatthou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  32:22 And Aaron said, Letnot the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that theyare set on mischief.32:23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land ofEgypt, we wot not what is become of him.32:24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break itoff. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there cameout this calf.32:25 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron hadmade them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 32:26 ThenMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'sside? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gatheredthemselves together unto him.32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Putevery man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gatethroughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man hiscompanion, and every man his neighbour.32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: andthere fell of the people that day about three thousand men.32:29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestowupon you a blessing this day.32:30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto thepeople, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto theLORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.32:31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people havesinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.32:32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me,I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.32:33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me,him will I blot out of my book.32:34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I havespoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee:nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.32:35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,which Aaron made.33:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou andthe people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, untothe land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying,Unto thy seed will I give it: 33:2 And I will send an angel beforethee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and theHittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 33:3 Unto aland flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst ofthee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in theway.33:4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: andno man did put on him his ornaments.33:5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children ofIsrael, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst ofthee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thyornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.33:6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornamentsby the mount Horeb.33:7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp,afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of thecongregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought theLORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which waswithout the camp.33:8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, andlooked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.33:9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, thecloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, andthe Lord talked with Moses.33:10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacledoor: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tentdoor.33:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speakethunto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servantJoshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of thetabernacle.33:12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring upthis people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send withme. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also foundgrace in my sight.33:13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight,shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace inthy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.33:14 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will givethee rest.33:15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry usnot up hence.33:16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people havefound grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? soshall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that areupon the face of the earth.33:17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also thatthou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I knowthee by name.33:18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.33:19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and Iwill proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be graciousto whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shewmercy.33:20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no mansee me, and live.33:21 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thoushalt stand upon a rock: 33:22 And it shall come to pass, while myglory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, andwill cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 33:23 And I will takeaway mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shallnot be seen.34:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone likeunto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that werein the first tables, which thou brakest.34:2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning untomount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.34:3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seenthroughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed beforethat mount.34:4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Mosesrose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as theLORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.34:5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,and proclaimed the name of the LORD.34:6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, TheLORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant ingoodness and truth, 34:7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgivinginiquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clearthe guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourthgeneration.34:8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, andworshipped.34:9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, letmy LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; andpardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.34:10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people Iwill do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor inany nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the workof the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.34:11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I driveout before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, andthe Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.34:12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with theinhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare inthe midst of thee: 34:13 But ye shall destroy their altars, breaktheir images, and cut down their groves: 34:14 For thou shalt worshipno other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:34:15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, andthey go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods,and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 34:16 And thou takeof their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoringafter their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.34:17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.34:18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thoushalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of themonth Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.34:19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling amongthy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.34:20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: andif thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All thefirstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear beforeme empty.34:21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shaltrest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.34:22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits ofwheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.34:23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before theLORD God, the God of Israel.34:24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thyborders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go upto appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year.34:25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left untothe morning.34:26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring untothe house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in hismother's milk.34:27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for afterthe tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and withIsrael.34:28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; hedid neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tablesthe words of the covenant, the ten commandments.34:29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai withthe two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from themount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while hetalked with him.34:30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold,the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.34:31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of thecongregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.34:32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gavethem in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mountSinai.34:33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on hisface.34:34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, hetook the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake untothe children of Israel that which he was commanded.34:35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skinof Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again,until he went in to speak with him.35:1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israeltogether, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hathcommanded, that ye should do them.35:2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shallbe to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doethwork therein shall be put to death.35:3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon thesabbath day.35:4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children ofIsrael, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying,35:5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is ofa willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, andsilver, and brass, 35:6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and finelinen, and goats' hair, 35:7 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers'skins, and shittim wood, 35:8 And oil for the light, and spices foranointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 35:9 And onyx stones, andstones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.35:10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all thatthe LORD hath commanded; 35:11 The tabernacle, his tent, and hiscovering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and hissockets, 35:12 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat,and the vail of the covering, 35:13 The table, and his staves, and allhis vessels, and the shewbread, 35:14 The candlestick also for thelight, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light,35:15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering inof the tabernacle, 35:16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasengrate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 35:17The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and thehanging for the door of the court, 35:18 The pins of the tabernacle,and the pins of the court, and their cords, 35:19 The cloths ofservice, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaronthe priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest'soffice.35:20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed fromthe presence of Moses.35:21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and everyone whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offeringto the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all hisservice, and for the holy garments.35:22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willinghearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets,all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering ofgold unto the LORD.35:23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, andscarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, andbadgers' skins, brought them.35:24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass broughtthe LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim woodfor any work of the service, brought it.35:25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with theirhands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and ofpurple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.35:26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spungoats' hair.35:27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, forthe ephod, and for the breastplate; 35:28 And spice, and oil for thelight, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.35:29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD,every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for allmanner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand ofMoses.35:30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hathcalled by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribeof Judah; 35:31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, inwisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner ofworkmanship; 35:32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, andin silver, and in brass, 35:33 And in the cutting of stones, to setthem, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.35:34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, andAholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.35:35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner ofwork, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of theembroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen,and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those thatdevise cunning work.36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, inwhom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work allmanner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all thatthe LORD had commanded.36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise heartedman, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whoseheart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 36:3 And theyreceived of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel hadbrought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make itwithal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary,came every man from his work which they made; 36:5 And they spake untoMoses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the serviceof the work, which the LORD commanded to make.36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimedthroughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any morework for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrainedfrom bringing.36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to makeit, and too much.36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work ofthe tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, andpurple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and thebreadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the otherfive curtains he coupled one unto another.36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from theselvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side ofanother curtain, in the coupling of the second.36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he inthe edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: theloops held one curtain to another.36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains oneunto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.36:14 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over thetabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits wasthe breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains bythemselves.36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtainin the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtainwhich coupleth the second.36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,that it might be one.36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, anda covering of badgers' skins above that.36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standingup.36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a boardone cubit and a half.36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thusdid he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for thesouth side southward: 36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made underthe twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, andtwo sockets under another board for his two tenons.36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward thenorth corner, he made twenty boards, 36:26 And their forty sockets ofsilver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under anotherboard.36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in thetwo sides.36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the headthereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteensockets of silver, under every board two sockets.36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the oneside of the tabernacle, 36:32 And five bars for the boards of theother side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of thetabernacle for the sides westward.36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from theone end to the other.36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings ofgold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and finetwined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaidthem with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them foursockets of silver.36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, andpurple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 36:38 Andthe five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid theirchapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were ofbrass.37:1 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a halfwas the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and acubit and a half the height of it: 37:2 And he overlaid it with puregold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.37:3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the fourcorners of it;

37:8 One cherub on the endon this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out ofthe mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.37:9 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and coveredwith their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another;even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.37:10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the lengththereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half theheight thereof: 37:11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and madethereunto a crown of gold round about.37:12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.37:13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings uponthe four corners that were in the four feet thereof.37:14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for thestaves to bear the table.37:15 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withgold, to bear the table.37:16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of puregold.37:17 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made hethe candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, andhis flowers, were of the same: 37:18 And six branches going out of thesides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one sidethereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other sidethereof: 37:19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in onebranch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds inanother branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branchesgoing out of the candlestick.37:20 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, hisknops, and his flowers: 37:21 And a knop under two branches of thesame, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under twobranches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.37:22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it wasone beaten work of pure gold.37:23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and hissnuffdishes, of pure gold.37:24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vesselsthereof.37:25 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of itwas a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and twocubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.37:26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and thesides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it acrown of gold round about.37:27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, bythe two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places forthe staves to bear it withal.37:28 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withgold.37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense ofsweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: fivecubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; itwas foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; thehorns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and theshovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all thevessels thereof made he of brass.38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under thecompass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,to be places for the staves.38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them withbrass.38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,to bear it withal;

and the overlaying of theirchapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filletedwith silver.38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, ofblue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twentycubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits,answerable to the hangings of the court.38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and theirfillets of silver.38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court roundabout, were of brass.38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle oftestimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses,for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaronthe priest.38:22 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,made all that the LORD commanded Moses.38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and inpurple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work ofthe holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and ninetalents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of thesanctuary.38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregationwas an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescoreand fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 38:26 A bekahfor every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of thesanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty yearsold and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and fivehundred and fifty men.38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets ofthe sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of thehundred talents, a talent for a socket.38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels hemade hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filletedthem.38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and twothousand and four hundred shekels.38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacleof the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate forit, and all the vessels of the altar, 38:31 And the sockets of thecourt round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pinsof the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about.39:1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths ofservice, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garmentsfor Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:2 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, andfine twined linen.39:3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it intowires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet,and in the fine linen, with cunning work.39:4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by thetwo edges was it coupled together.39:5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of thesame, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, andscarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven,as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.39:7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they shouldbe stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORDcommanded Moses.39:8 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of theephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.39:9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span wasthe length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.39:10 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was asardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.39:11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.39:12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.39:13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they wereinclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.39:14 And the stones were according to the names of the children ofIsrael, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of asignet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.39:15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, ofwreathen work of pure gold.39:16 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and putthe two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.39:17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings onthe ends of the breastplate.39:18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in thetwo ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, beforeit.39:19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends ofthe breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of theephod inward.39:20 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the twosides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over againstthe other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.39:21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings ofthe ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curiousgirdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed fromthe ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.39:23 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole ofan habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should notrend.39:24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.39:25 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between thepomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between thepomegranates; 39:26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and apomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as theLORD commanded Moses.39:27 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, andfor his sons, 39:28 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets offine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 39:29 And agirdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, ofneedlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, andwrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESSTO THE LORD.39:31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high uponthe mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.39:32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of thecongregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to allthat the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.39:33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and allhis furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, andhis sockets, 39:34 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and thecovering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 39:35 Theark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat,39:36 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 39:37The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps tobe set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light,39:38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweetincense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 39:39 The brasenaltar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, thelaver and his foot, 39:40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, andhis sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and hispins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for thetent of the congregation, 39:41 The cloths of service to do service inthe holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and hissons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.39:42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the childrenof Israel made all the work.39:43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had doneit as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Mosesblessed them.40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 40:2 On the first day ofthe first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of thecongregation.40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and coverthe ark with the vail.40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the thingsthat are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in thecandlestick, and light the lamps thereof.40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before theark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to thetabernacle.40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before thedoor of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregationand the altar, and shalt put water therein.40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up thehanging at the court gate.40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle,and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vesselsthereof: and it shall be holy.40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and allhis vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar mostholy.40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him,and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 40:15And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, thatthey may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointingshall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout theirgenerations.40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, sodid he.40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, onthe first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and rearedup his pillars.40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put thecovering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set thestaves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 40:21And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of thecovering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commandedMoses.40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon theside of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as theLORD had commanded Moses.40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, overagainst the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commandedMoses.40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregationbefore the vail: 40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORDcommanded Moses.40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of thetabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it theburnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation andthe altar, and put water there, to wash withal.40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and theirfeet thereat: 40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation,and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORDcommanded Moses.40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and thealtar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished thework.40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the gloryof the LORD filled the tabernacle.40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of thecongregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of theLORD filled the tabernacle.40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, thechildren of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 40:37 But if thecloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that itwas taken up.40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, andfire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,throughout all their journeys.The Third Book of Moses:  Called Leviticus1:1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of thetabernacle of the congregation, saying, 1:2 Speak unto the children ofIsrael, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering untothe LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of theherd, and of the flock.1:3 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer amale without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will atthe door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.1:4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; andit shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.1:5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests,Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood roundabout upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation.1:6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces.1:7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar,and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 1:8 And the priests, Aaron'ssons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon thewood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 1:9 But his inwardsand his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all onthe altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.1:10 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or ofthe goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male withoutblemish.1:11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward beforethe LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his bloodround about upon the altar.1:12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat:and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the firewhich is upon the altar: 1:13 But he shall wash the inwards and thelegs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it uponthe altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of asweet savour unto the LORD.1:14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be offowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of youngpigeons.1:15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off hishead, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrungout at the side of the altar: 1:16 And he shall pluck away his cropwith his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, bythe place of the ashes: 1:17 And he shall cleave it with the wingsthereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn itupon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burntsacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.2:1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, hisoffering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, andput frankincense thereon: 2:2 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sonsthe priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flourthereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof;and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 2:3 And theremnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is athing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.2:4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in theoven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, orunleavened wafers anointed with oil.2:5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall beof fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.2:6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meatoffering.2:7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, itshall be made of fine flour with oil.2:8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of thesethings unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, heshall bring it unto the altar.2:9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorialthereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made byfire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.2:10 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's andhis sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD madeby fire.2:11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall bemade with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in anyoffering of the LORD made by fire.2:12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them untothe LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.2:13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season withsalt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God tobe lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shaltoffer salt.2:14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto theLORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits greenears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.2:15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: itis a meat offering.2:16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beatencorn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincensethereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.3:1 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offerit of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer itwithout blemish before the LORD.3:2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and killit at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sonsthe priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.3:3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering anoffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth theinwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:4 And the twokidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and thecaul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.3:5 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burntsacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is anoffering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.3:6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto theLORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it withoutblemish.3:7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it beforethe LORD.3:8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and killit before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shallsprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.3:9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering anoffering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the wholerump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat thatcovereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 3:10And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by theflanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall hetake away.3:11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire unto the LORD.3:12 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before theLORD.3:13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it beforethe tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shallsprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.3:14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made byfire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fatthat is upon the inwards, 3:15 And the two kidneys, and the fat thatis upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver,with the kidneys, it shall he take away.3:16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food ofthe offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is theLORD's.3:17 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughoutall your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 4:2 Speak unto the childrenof Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against anyof the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not tobe done, and shall do against any of them: 4:3 If the priest that isanointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bringfor his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemishunto the LORD for a sin offering.4:4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon thebullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.4:5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood,and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:6 And the priestshall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seventimes before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.4:7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of thealtar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle ofthe congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at thebottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.4:8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for thesin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat thatis upon the inwards, 4:9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is uponthem, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with thekidneys, it shall he take away, 4:10 As it was taken off from thebullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burnthem upon the altar of the burnt offering.4:11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 4:12 Even the wholebullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place,where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire:where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.4:13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have donesomewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning thingswhich should not be done, and are guilty; 4:14 When the sin, whichthey have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shalloffer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacleof the congregation.4:15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon thehead of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killedbefore the LORD.4:16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock'sblood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 4:17 And the priest shalldip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven timesbefore the LORD, even before the vail.4:18 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altarwhich is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of thecongregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of thealtar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle ofthe congregation.4:19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon thealtar.4:20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for asin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make anatonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.4:21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burnhim as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for thecongregation.4:22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignoranceagainst any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning thingswhich should not be done, and is guilty; 4:23 Or if his sin, whereinhe hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, akid of the goats, a male without blemish: 4:24 And he shall lay hishand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where theykill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.4:25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering withhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burntoffering.4:26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of thesacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonementfor him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.4:27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, whilehe doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORDconcerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 4:28 Orif his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shallbring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, forhis sin which he hath sinned.4:29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, andslay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.4:30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger,and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shallpour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.4:31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is takenaway from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shallburn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and thepriest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.4:32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it afemale without blemish.4:33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, andslay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burntoffering.4:34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering withhis finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:4:35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of thelamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and thepriest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings madeby fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for hissin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.5:1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is awitness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it,then he shall bear his iniquity.5:2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase ofan unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase ofunclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shallbe unclean, and guilty.5:3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness itbe that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when heknoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.5:4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to dogood, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and itbe hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in oneof these.5:5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things,that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 5:6 And heshall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which hehath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats,for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for himconcerning his sin.5:7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for histrespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for aburnt offering.5:8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer thatwhich is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from hisneck, but shall not divide it asunder: 5:9 And he shall sprinkle ofthe blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the restof the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is asin offering.5:10 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according tothe manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sinwhich he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.5:11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two youngpigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenthpart of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oilupon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is asin offering.5:12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall takehis handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar,according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sinoffering.5:13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching hissin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him:and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering.5:14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 5:15 If a soul commit atrespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD;then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram withoutblemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.5:16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in theholy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto thepriest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram ofthe trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.5:17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which areforbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wistit not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.5:18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, withthy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and thepriest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorancewherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him.5:19 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed againstthe LORD.6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:2 If a soul sin, andcommit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in thatwhich was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing takenaway by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 6:3 Or have foundthat which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; inany of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 6:4 Then it shallbe, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore thatwhich he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfullygotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thingwhich he found, 6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; heshall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth partmore thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the dayof his trespass offering.6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ramwithout blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespassoffering, unto the priest: 6:7 And the priest shall make an atonementfor him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing ofall that he hath done in trespassing therein.6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:9 Command Aaron and hissons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burntoffering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto themorning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linenbreeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which thefire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shallput them beside the altar.6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, andcarry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall notbe put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, andlay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon thefat of the peace offerings.6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never goout.6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shalloffer it before the LORD, before the altar.6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meatoffering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which isupon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweetsavour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: withunleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court ofthe tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them fortheir portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is thesin offering, and as the trespass offering.6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. Itshall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning theofferings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shallbe holy.6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:20 This is the offeringof Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in theday when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour fora meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereofat night.6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thoushalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shaltthou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shalloffer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be whollyburnt.6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: itshall not be eaten.6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6:25 Speak unto Aaron andto his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the placewhere the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killedbefore the LORD: it is most holy.6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holyplace shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of thecongregation.6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and whenthere is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shaltwash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: andif it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsedin water.6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is mostholy.6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into thetabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place,shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is mostholy.7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they killthe trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle roundabout upon the altar.7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and thefat that covereth the inwards, 7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fatthat is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is abovethe liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 7:5 And the priestshall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto theLORD: it is a trespass offering.7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eatenin the holy place: it is most holy.7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is onelaw for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall haveit.7:8 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even thepriest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which hehath offered.7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all thatis dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest'sthat offereth it.7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all thesons of Aaron have, one as much as another.7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which heshall offer unto the LORD.7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with thesacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, andunleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, offine flour, fried.7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened breadwith the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for anheave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's thatsprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings forthanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shallnot leave any of it until the morning.7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntaryoffering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth hissacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third dayshall be burnt with fire.7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offeringsbe eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neithershall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be anabomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten;it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be cleanshall eat thereof.7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peaceofferings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness uponhim, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as theuncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable uncleanthing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, whichpertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from hispeople.7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:23 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, orof sheep, or of goat.7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat ofthat which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but yeshall in no wise eat of it.7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer anoffering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth itshall be cut off from his people.7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowlor of beast, in any of your dwellings.7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even thatsoul shall be cut off from his people.7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7:29 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of hispeace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORDof the sacrifice of his peace offerings.7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire,the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may bewaved for a wave offering before the LORD.7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breastshall be Aaron's and his sons'.7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heaveoffering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peaceofferings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of thechildren of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings,and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by astatute for ever from among the children of Israel.7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of theanointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire,in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in thepriest's office; 7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of thechildren of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute forever throughout their generations.7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, andof the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of theconsecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 7:38 Whichthe LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commandedthe children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in thewilderness of Sinai.8:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:2 Take Aaron and his sonswith him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock forthe sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 8:3And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of thetabernacle of the congregation.8:4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly wasgathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.8:5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which theLORD commanded to be done.8:6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.8:7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, andclothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girdedhim with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto himtherewith.8:8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in thebreastplate the Urim and the Thummim.8:9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even uponhis forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as theLORD commanded Moses.8:10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle andall that was therein, and sanctified them.8:11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointedthe altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, tosanctify them.8:12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, andanointed him, to sanctify him.8:13 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, andgirded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORDcommanded Moses.8:14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron andhis sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sinoffering.8:15 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon thehorns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified thealtar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctifiedit, to make reconciliation upon it.8:16 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caulabove the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burnedit upon the altar.8:17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burntwith fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.8:18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and hissons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.8:19 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altarround about.8:20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and thepieces, and the fat.8:21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burntthe whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweetsavour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORDcommanded Moses.8:22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaronand his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.8:23 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put itupon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his righthand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.8:24 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon thetip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, andupon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the bloodupon the altar round about.8:25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was uponthe inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, andtheir fat, and the right shoulder: 8:26 And out of the basket ofunleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavenedcake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on thefat, and upon the right shoulder: 8:27 And he put all upon Aaron'shands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offeringbefore the LORD.8:28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on thealtar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweetsavour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.8:29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offeringbefore the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; asthe LORD commanded Moses.8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which wasupon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments,and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; andsanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons'garments with him.8:31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at thedoor of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with thebread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying,Aaron and his sons shall eat it.8:32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall yeburn with fire.8:33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be atan end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.8:34 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, tomake an atonement for you.8:35 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of theLORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.8:36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded bythe hand of Moses.9:1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron andhis sons, and the elders of Israel; 9:2 And he said unto Aaron, Takethee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering,without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.9:3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take yea kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both ofthe first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 9:4 Also abullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD;and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appearunto you.9:5 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacleof the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stoodbefore the LORD.9:6 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that yeshould do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.9:7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sinoffering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself,and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make anatonement for them; as the LORD commanded.9:8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sinoffering, which was for himself.9:9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dippedhis finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, andpoured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 9:10 But the fat, andthe kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, heburnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.9:11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.9:12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented untohim the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.9:13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the piecesthereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.9:14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon theburnt offering on the altar.9:15 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, whichwas the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it forsin, as the first.9:16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according tothe manner.9:17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of themorning.9:18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peaceofferings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented untohim the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 9:19 Andthe fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that whichcovereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:9:20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat uponthe altar: 9:21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved fora wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.9:22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them,and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burntoffering, and peace offerings.9:23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation,and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORDappeared unto all the people.9:24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed uponthe altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the peoplesaw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.10:1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them hiscenser, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offeredstrange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not.10:2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, andthey died before the LORD.10:3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before allthe people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.10:4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel theuncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethrenfrom before the sanctuary out of the camp.10:5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of thecamp; as Moses had said.10:6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, hissons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die,and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, thewhole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.10:7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of thecongregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is uponyou. And they did according to the word of Moses.10:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 10:9 Do not drink wine norstrong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into thetabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations: 10:10 And that ye may put differencebetween holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 10:11 And thatye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORDhath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.10:12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of theofferings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven besidethe altar: for it is most holy: 10:13 And ye shall eat it in the holyplace, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices ofthe LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.10:14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a cleanplace; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they bethy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices ofpeace offerings of the children of Israel.10:15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with theofferings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offeringbefore the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by astatute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.10:16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, thesons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 10:17 Wherefore have yenot eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy,and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, tomake atonement for them before the LORD?  10:18 Behold, the blood ofit was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed haveeaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.10:19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offeredtheir sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and suchthings have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day,should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?  10:20 And whenMoses heard that, he was content.11:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,11:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beastswhich ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.11:3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth thecud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.11:4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, orof them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth thecud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.11:5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not thehoof; he is unclean unto you.11:6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not thehoof; he is unclean unto you.11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.11:8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye nottouch; they are unclean to you.11:9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hathfins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, themshall ye eat.11:10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in therivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing whichis in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 11:11 Theyshall be even an abomination unto you;

11:22 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after hiskind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after hiskind, and the grasshopper after his kind.11:23 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,shall be an abomination unto you.11:24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth thecarcase of them shall be unclean until the even.11:25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall washhis clothes, and be unclean until the even.11:26 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is notclovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every onethat toucheth them shall be unclean.11:27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beaststhat go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth theircarcase shall be unclean until the even.11:28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes,and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you.11:29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping thingsthat creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoiseafter his kind, 11:30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and thelizard, and the snail, and the mole.11:31 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever dothtouch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.11:32 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall,it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, orskin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, itmust be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so itshall be cleansed.11:33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,whatsoever is in it shall be unclean;

for they are anabomination.11:43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thingthat creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them,that ye should be defiled thereby.11:44 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctifyyourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall yedefile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth uponthe earth.11:45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt,to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.11:46 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of everyliving creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature thatcreepeth upon the earth: 11:47 To make a difference between theunclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and thebeast that may not be eaten.12:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12:2 Speak unto thechildren of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born aman child: then she shall be unclean seven days;

she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into thesanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.12:5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean twoweeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood ofher purifying threescore and six days.12:6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, orfor a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burntoffering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering,unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:12:7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement forher; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This isthe law for her that hath born a male or a female.12:8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring twoturtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and theother for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement forher, and she shall be clean.13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 13:2 When a manshall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot,and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then heshall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons thepriests: 13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin ofthe flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and theplague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plagueof leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce himunclean.13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and insight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turnedwhite; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague sevendays: 13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and,behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spreadnot in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not inthe skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: andhe shall wash his clothes, and be clean.13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that hehath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen ofthe priest again.13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in theskin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be broughtunto the priest; 13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, ifthe rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white,and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 13:11 It is an old leprosyin the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean,and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosycover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even tohis foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13:13 Then the priest shallconsider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, heshall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turnedwhite: he is clean.13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to beunclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, heshall come unto the priest; 13:17 And the priest shall see him: and,behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shallpronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean.13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,and is healed, 13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a whiterising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it beshewed to the priest; 13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold,it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turnedwhite; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague ofleprosy broken out of the boil.13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no whitehairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhatdark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:22 And if itspread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce himunclean: it is a plague.13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it isa burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hotburning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,somewhat reddish, or white; 13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it:and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it bein sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of theburning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is theplague of leprosy.13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no whitehair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, butbe somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 13:27And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it bespread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce himunclean: it is the plague of leprosy.
